msgid "Almost all information is optional. This allows tools outside the Python ecosystem, such as Linux package managers, to integrate with Python tooling as much as possible. For example, even if an installer cannot easily provide a list of installed files in a format specific to Python tooling, it should still record the name and version of the installed project."

msgid "This directory is named as ``{name}-{version}.dist-info``, with ``name`` and ``version`` fields corresponding to :ref:`core-metadata`. Both fields must be normalized (see :pep:`PEP 503 <503#normalized-names>` and :pep:`PEP 440 <440#normalization>` for the definition of normalization for each field respectively), and replace dash (``-``) characters with underscore (``_``) chacaters, so the ``.dist-info`` directory always has exactly one dash (``-``) character in its stem, separating the ``name`` and ``version`` fields."

msgid "Historically, tools have failed to replace dot characters or normalize case in the ``name`` field, or not perform normalization in the ``version`` field. Tools consuming ``.dist-info`` directories should expect those fields to be unnormalized, and treat them as equivalent to their normalized counterparts. New tools that write ``.dist-info`` directories MUST normalize both ``name`` and ``version`` fields using the rules described above, and existing tools are encouraged to start normalizing those fields."

msgid "The ``.dist-info`` directory's name is formatted to unambigiously represent a distribution as a filesystem path. Tools presenting a distribution name to a user should avoid using the normalized name, and instead present the specified name (when needed prior to resolution to an installed package), or read the respective fields in Core Metadata, since values listed there are unescaped and accurately reflect the distribution. Libraries should provide API for such tools to consume, so tools can have access to the unnormalized name when displaying distrubution information."
