msgid "When building a :term:`source distribution <Source Distribution (or \"sdist\")>` for your package, by default only a minimal set of files are included.  You may find yourself wanting to include extra files in the source distribution, such as an authors/contributors file, a :file:`docs/` directory, or a directory of data files used for testing purposes.  There may even be extra files that you *need* to include; for example, if your :file:`setup.py` computes your project's ``long_description`` by reading from both a README and a changelog file, you'll need to include both those files in the sdist so that people that build or install from the sdist get the correct results."
