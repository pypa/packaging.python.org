Where do packages come from?
============================
Packages can be distributed in a bunch of ways! PyPI is a great way to get packages that you want, but by no means the only way! Here are three main ways to get packages that you want:

* Use pip to install packages that are hosted on PyPI
* Download the source code from a version control repository like GitHub
* Download an archive from someone's website


PyPI is an index of packages- it maintains a searchable list of all of the packages people submit to it.  That makes it easy for people to find packages that they might want to use.   But, PyPI is not the only index. It is certainly popular, but there are a number of other ways to find packages on-line. You can see this list (https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyPiImplementations#Tools_.2F_Extensions) that gives you a few other indexes that implement the same standard. That means you can still use pip with them. 

An example using Django
--

Let's talk about an example: the Django package. Django is a web framework for Python.  Let's take a look at the three main places you might want to look for package sources:

1. PyPI and pip
----

Django is released on PyPI.  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django

2. Version Control Repository
----

In this case, Django is available on GitHub. https://github.com/django/django


3. Downloading from a website 
----
Django's project webiste allows you to download a tar.gz file. https://www.djangoproject.com/download/



All three of these get you to roughly the same place, so it all depends on where you can find them.
