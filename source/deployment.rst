Overview
========


Supporting multiple hardware platforms
--------------------------------------

::

  FIXME

  Meaning: x86, x64, ARM, others?

  For Python-only :term:`distribution packages <distribution package>`, it
  *should* be straightforward to deploy on all platforms where Python can run.

  For :term:`packages <distribution package>` with binary extensions,
  deployment is a major headache.  Not only
  must the extensions be built on all the combinations of operating system and
  hardware platform, but they must also be tested, preferably on continuous
  integration platforms.  The issues are similar to the "multiple python
  versions" section above, not sure whether this should be a separate section.
  Even on Windows x64, both the 32 bit and 64 bit versions of Python enjoy
  significant usage.
