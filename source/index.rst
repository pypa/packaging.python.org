Welcome to the *Python Packaging User Guide*.
This collection of tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, specifications, and
references is a central place to learn about Python packages, how to distribute
and install libraries and projects, and build awareness of available modern tools.

This guide is maintained on `GitHub`_ by the :doc:`Python Packaging Authority <pypa:index>`.
We encourage and happily accept :doc:`contributions <contribute>`. ðŸ˜Š

Overview
========

The :doc:`overview` section provides a high-level view of Python packaging
and its use when preparing and distributing projects.
This section helps you become familiar with available tools and
processes.
It includes what packaging is, the problems that it solves, and
key considerations.
To get an overview of the workflow used to publish your code, see
:doc:`packaging flow <flow>`.

Tutorials

Tutorials are the best place to start for anyone new to installing or creating Python Packages.
Tutorials walk through the steps needed to complete a project for the first time.
The :doc:`tutorials/index` section includes:

* A :doc:`tutorial on installing packages <tutorials/installing-packages>`
* A :doc:`tutorial on managing application dependencies <tutorials/managing-dependencies>`
  in a version controlled project
* A :doc:`tutorial on packaging and distributing <tutorials/packaging-projects>`
  your project

How-to Guides

How-to Guides provide step-by-step instructions to perform a specific task.
These guides are written for users who are already familiar with Python packaging.

The :doc:`guides/index` section is organized in the following areas:

* package installation
* building and distributing packages
* miscellaneous topics

Explanations
============

The :doc:`Explanations and Discussions <discussions/index>` section presents
in-depth explanations and discussion about a packaging topic. These documents
explain the rationale or "why" something is done.

Specifications
==============

The :doc:`specifications/index` section documents the packaging interoperability specifications.

Reference
=========

The :doc:`references/index` section describes projects and gives informative information.
These resources typically answer "What is..." questions. The section includes:

* The list of :doc:`other projects <key_projects>` maintained by members of the Python Packaging Authority.
* The :doc:`glossary` for definitions of terms used in Python packaging.
