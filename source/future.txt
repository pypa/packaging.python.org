The Future of Python Packaging
==============================

What's wrong now
================

As of March 2013, the Python packaging ecosystem is currently in a rather
confusing state. If you're starting a new Python project, should you use the
``distutils`` system in the standard library to publish your software? Or should
you use ``setuptools``? If you decide to use ``setuptools``, should you download
the PyPI distribution that is actually *called* ``setuptools``, or should you
download the competing ``distribute`` distribution, which *also* provides
``setuptools``?

If you're on Linux, it's quite likely your operating system already *comes* with
a pre-installed copy of ``setuptools``. Perhaps you can use that?

The above options all use a Python script called ``setup.py`` to configure the
build and distribution software. You'll see plenty of essays on the internet
decrying this use of an executable configuration system, and promoting the use
of static configuration metadata instead.  So, perhaps the answer is to avoid
all of them and use ``distutils2`` (or ```d2to1``), with a ``setup.cfg`` file,
or ``bento`` with its ``bento.info`` file instead?

Even on the *installation* side, things are confusing. ``setuptools`` and
``distribute`` both provide a utility called ``easy_install``. Should you use
that? But there are websites telling you that ``easy_install`` is bad and you
should use ``pip`` instead!

Or perhaps everything above is wrong, and you should be using ``hashdist``,
``conda`` or ``zc.buildout`` to create fully defined stacks of dependencies,
including non-Python software?

HALP! MAKE IT STOP!


How we got here
===============

(This section is painted in fairly broad strokes, both because the details don't
really matter, and also because I don't want to go double check everything I
would have to in order to get the details right)

Python's packaging history largely starts with the inclusion of the
``distutils`` project into the standard library. This system was really built to
handle distribution of source modules and simple C extensions, but ended up
being pushed well beyond that task. I was lucky enough to meet Greg Ward at
PyCon US 2013, and he has posted a great write-up of the `early history of
distutils`__ as part of his post-conference review.

Another key piece of the puzzle was the creation of the Python Package Index to
serve as a central repository for Python packages that could be shared by the
entire community, without being coupled to any particular operating system or
platform specific packaging format.

One notable enhancement was Phillip Eby's ``setuptools``, which became popular
after he created it as part of the work he was doing for OSAF. This was
subsequently forked to create the ``distribute`` project (like ``setuptools``
itself, the ``distribute`` distribution installs both the ``setuptools`` and
``pkg_resources`` modules on to the target system.

The distutils project suffered from being poorly defined and documented in many
ways. In particular, the phases of distribution were not well documented and the
main "metadata" file used to drive the process was a full-fledged Python
script. This contrasts with other packaging systems, such as RPM, where the main
metadata file may *contain* executable code, but is not itself executable.

setuptools took that already complicated system, and then layered *more*
complications on top (up to and including monkey-patching the standard
library distutils pacakge when imported). This limited the adoption of
setuptools to those users that *really* needed the features it provided.

Many other parts of the Python community didn't see the necessity, and
instead rejected setuptools as an opaque blob of magic that they didn't
want anywhere near their systems. setuptools has also suffered PR
problems due to its close association with ``easy_install``, the
default behaviour of which violated many users and system administrators
assumptions about how a language specific packaging tool should behave.

The misbehaviour of ``easy_install`` also gave the associated "egg"
binary format a poor reputation that it really didn't deserve (although
that format does have some genuine problems, such as being difficult
to transform into platform specific binary formats, such as RPM, in a
way that complies with typical packaging policies for those platforms,
as well as failing to adequately convey compatibility limitations in
the egg filenames. Both of these deficiencies are addressed at least to
some degree by the recently approved ``wheel`` format).

The setuptools project also inherited many of the distutils documentation
problems, although it does at least provide reasonable documentation for
most of its `file formats`__ (the significant formats on that page are
``requires.txt``, ``entry_points.txt`` and the overall egg format itself).
By contrast, even today, you won't find a clear specification of the
expected contents of a Python ``sdist`` archive.

The more recent ``pip`` project builds on the setuptools defined metadata
and provides similar functionality to ``easy_install``, but does so in a
way that is `far more palatable`__ to a wider range of Python users.

The way setuptools was written also coupled it tightly to internal details
of the standard library's distutils package. This coupling, along with
some significant miscommunication between the setuptools and distribute
developers and the core development team, had effectively frozen feature
development within distutils itself for a few years, as a request
to avoid all refactoring changes in maintenance releases managed to
morph into a complete ban on new distutils features for a number of
releases.

The ``distribute`` project was created as a fork of setuptools that aims to
act as a drop-in replacement for setuptools, with much clearer documentation
and a broader developer base. However, this project is limited in its
ability to move away from any undesirable default behaviours in setuptools,
and the naming creates confusion amongst new users.

These issues led to the creation of the ``distutils2`` project, as a way to
start migrating to an updated packaging infrastructure. As the core
development team largely wasn't concerned about cross platform packaging
issues, the burden of guiding the packaging improvement effort landed on a
small number of heads (mostly Tarek Ziadé and Éric Araujo, and they became
core developers in large part *because* they were working on packaging and
the rest of us were just happy that someone else had volunteered to handle
the job).

The ``distutils2`` developers did a lot of things right, including
identifying a core issue with setuptools and easy_install, where behaviour
in certain edge cases (such as attempting to interpret nonsensical version
numbers) resulted in *some* kind of answer (but probably not the answer you
wanted) rather than a clear error. This lead to the creation of a number of
PEPs, most notably :pep:`345` (v1.2 of the metadata standard) and :pep:`386`
(the versioning scheme for metadata v1.2), in an attempt to better define
the expected behaviour in those edge cases. This effort was also responsible
for the creation of the standard installation database format defined in
:pep:`376`, which is what allows ``pip``, unlike ``easy_install``, to
support uninstallation of previously installed distributions.

At the PyCon 2011 language summit, the decision was made to adopt distutils2
wholesale into Python 3.3 as the ``packaging`` package. At `Éric Araujo's
recommendation`_, that decision was reversed late in the Python 3.3 release
cycle, as he felt the distutils2 code, and the PEPs it was based on simply
weren't ready as the systematic fix that was needed to convince the
community as a whole to migrate to the new packaging infrastructure.

In the ensuing discussion, many good points were raised. This essay started
as my attempt to take a step back and *clearly define the problem that needs
to be solved*. Past efforts have tried to work from a goal statement that
consisted of little more than "fix Python packaging", and we can be
confident that without a clearer understanding of the problems with the
status quo, we aren't going to be able to devise a path forward that
works for all of these groups:

* currently satisfied distutils users
* currently satisfied setuptools/distribute users
* users that are not happy with either setuptools *or* distutils

Another significant recent development is that the setuptools and distribute
developers recently merged the two projects back together (in the
setuptools 0.7 release), creating a combined setuptools distribution that
includes the best aspects of both of these tools. The merger will also make
it easier to make incremental changes to the default behaviour (especially of
``easy_install``) without abruptly breaking anyone's tools.

Our `Q & A panel`__ at PyCon US 2013 is worth a look for interested folks.

The Phases of Distribution
==========================

One component severely lacking in the status quo is a well-defined model
of the phases of distribution. An overall packaging system needs to be
able to handle several distinct phases, especially the transitions between
them. For Python's purposes, these phases are:

* Development: working with source code in a VCS checkout
* Source Distribution: creating and distributing a source archive
* Building: creating binary files from a source archive
* Binary Distribution: creating and distributing a binary archive
* Installation: installing files from a binary archive onto the target system
* Execution: importing or otherwise running the installed files

The setuptools distribution covers *all six* of those phases. A key goal
of any new packaging system should be to cleanly decouple the phases and make
it easier for developers to choose the right tool for each phase rather
than having one gigantic project that handles everything internally with
poorly defined data interchange formats. Having a single project handle
everything should still be *possible* (at least for backwards compatibility,
even if for no other reason), it just shouldn't be required.

distutils isn't much better, since it is still an unholy combination of a
build system *and* a packaging system. Even RPM doesn't go that far: it's
"build system" is just the ability to run a shell script that invokes
your *real* build system. In many ways, distutils was really intended as
Python's equivalent of ``make`` (or perhaps ``make`` + ``autotools``),
so we're currently in the situation Linux distributions were in before the
creation of dedicated package management utilities like ``apt`` and ``yum``.

It isn't really a specific phase, but it's also desirable for a
meta-packaging system to define a standard mechanism for invoking a
distribution's automated test suite and indicate whether or not it
passed all its tests.


A Meta-Packaging System
=======================

My goal for Python 3.4 is to enable a solid *meta-packaging* system,
where we have multiple, cooperating, tools, each covering distinct
phases of distribution. In particular, a project's choice of
build system should NOT affect on end user's choice of installation
program.

In this system, there are a few key points where interoperability
between different tools is needed:

#. For binary distribution, an installation tool should be able to unpack
   and install the contents of the binary archive to the appropriate
   locations, *without* needing to install the build system used to create
   the archive.
#. For source distribution, an installation tool should be able to identify
   the appropriate build tool, download and install it, and then invoke it
   in a standard fashion, *without* needing any knowledge of any particular
   build systems.
#. The central package index needs to accept and publish distribution
   metadata in a format that is easy to consume
#. Installation tools need to store the distribution metadata in a standard
   format so other tools know where to find it and how to read it.

The development phase and the execution phase are the domain of build tools
and runtime support libraries respectively. The interfaces they expose to
end users in those phases are up to the specific tool or library - the
meta-packaging system only cares about the interfaces between the
automated tools.


The wheel format
================

The binary ``wheel`` format, created by Daniel Holth, and formally
specified in :pep:`427`, is aimed at solving two problems:

* initially, acting as a cache format for ``pip``, allowing that tool to
  avoiding having to rebuild packages from source in each virtual
  environment
* eventually, as build tools gain the ability to publish wheels to PyPI,
  and more projects start to do so, as a way to support distribution of
  Python software that doesn't require the invocation of ``./setup.py
  install`` on the target system

This is a critical step, as it finally allows the build systems to be
systematically decoupled from the installation systems - if ``pip`` can
get its hands on a ``wheel`` file for a project, it will be possible to
install it, even if it uses some arcane build tools that only run on
specific systems.

In many respects, ``wheel`` is a *simpler* format than the setuptools
egg format. It deliberately avoids all of the features of eggs (or, more
accurately, ``easy_install``) which resulted in runtime modifications to
the target environment. Those were the features that people disliked as
being excessively magical, and which limited the popularity of the format.

In two respects, wheel is *more* complex than the egg format. Firstly,
the compatibility tagging scheme used in file names (defined in :pep:`425`)
is more comprehensive, allowing the interpreter implementation and version
to be clearly specified, along with the Python C ABI requirement, and the
underlying platform compatibility.

Secondly, the wheel format allows *multiple* target directories to be
defined, as is supported by the ``distutils`` installation operation. This
allows the format to support correctly spreading files to appropriate
directories on a target system, rather than dropping all files into a
single directory in violation of platform standards (although the wheel
format *does* also support the latter style).


Metadata v2.0
=============

My own efforts are currently focused primarily on :pep:`426`, the latest
version of the standard for Python distribution metadata. My aim
with this latest version of the metadata is to address the issues which
prevented widespread adoption of the previous version by:

* deciding on appropriate default behaviour for tools based on the
  experiences of other development language communities
* supporting additional features of setuptools/distribute that were
  missing from the previous version of the standard
* engaging with the setuptools developers (following the recent merger of
  distribute back into setuptools) to ensure that project is able to
  start emitting the new metadata format
  within a reasonable period of time after the standard is accepted
* simplifying backwards compatibility with older versions of both
  setuptools and distribute by adding a recommendation for installation
  tools to correctly generate legacy versions of the metadata that those
  two projects will be able to easily read

I also plan to design this standard to use JSON as the on-disk serialisation
format. There are four reasons for this:

* Over time, the original simple Key:Value format has grown various ad hoc
  extensions to support structured data that doesn't fit the simple key-value
  format. Some fields are "multi-use", some allow embedded environment
  markers, one is a space separated sequence of values. Switching to JSON
  means structured data is supported simply and cleanly, without these ad
  hoc complexities in the parsing rules.
* to completely replace the existing ``./setup.py install`` idiom,
  :pep:`426` is going to need to define a post-install hook, and conversion
  to a more structured format makes it easier to pass the metadata to the
  registered hook
* :pep:`376` currently ignores the existence of import hooks completely: it is
  only correctly defined for Python distributions that are installed to the
  filesystem. Fixing that will require a structured metadata representation
  that can be returned from an appropriate importer method.
* TUF (The Update Framework), is an intriguing approach proposed for adding
  a usable end-to-end security solution to the Python packaging ecosystem.
  One feature of TUF is the ability to embed arbitrary JSON metadata
  describing "targets", which, in Python's case, would generally mean
  source and binary archives for distributions.

Converting the earlier versions of PEP 426 (which still use the old key:value
format as a basis) to a useful platform-neutral JSON compatible metadata
format is actually fairly straightforward, and Daniel Holth already has a
draft implementation of the bdist_wheel distutils command that emits a
preliminary version of it.


Secure metadata distribution
============================

In the wake of the rubygems.org compromise, a topic of particular interest on
catalog-sig is the definition of a reliable, usable, end-to-end security
mechanism that allows end users the option of either trusting PyPI to
maintain the integrity of distributed packages, *or* maintaining their
own subset of trusted developer keys.

While I'm not actively working on this myself, I'm definitely interested
in the topic, and currently favour the concept of adopting
`The Update Framework`_, a general purpose software updating architecture,
designed to protect from a wide variety of known attack vectors on software
distribution systems. I particularly like the fact that TUF may not only
address the end-to-end security problem, but also provide a *far* superior
metadata publication system to that provided by the current incarnation
of the PyPI web service.

A number of the TUF developers are now active on catalog-sig, attempting
to devise an approach to securing the *existing* PyPI metadata, which
may then evolve over time to take advantage of more of TUF's features.
