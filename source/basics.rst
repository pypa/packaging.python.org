.. Editing notes:

   This document targets at an intermediate audience,
   lower-mid-level to early-advanced Python developers. It's expected
   that most developers finding this document will have already
   encountered several packaging technologies, through package
   managers, app stores, pip, and so forth. They may have even
   shipped a few packages of their own. They are smart enough to have
   built something to ship, and experienced (or frustrated) enough to
   know to search for prior art.
