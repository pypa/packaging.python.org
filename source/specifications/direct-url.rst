==========================================================
Recording the Direct URL Origin of installed distributions
==========================================================

This document specifies a :file:`direct_url.json` file in the
``*.dist-info`` directory of an installed distribution, to record the
Direct URL Origin of the distribution. The general structure and usage of
``*.dist-info`` directories is described in :ref:`recording-installed-packages`.

Specification
=============

The :file:`direct_url.json` file MUST be created in the :file:`*.dist-info`
directory by installers when installing a distribution from a requirement
specifying a direct URL reference (including a VCS URL).

This file MUST NOT be created when installing a distribution from an other
type of requirement (i.e. name plus version specifier).

This JSON file MUST be a dictionary, compliant with :rfc:`8259` and UTF-8 encoded.

If present, it MUST contain at least two fields. The first one is ``url``, with
type ``string``. Depending on what ``url`` refers to, the second field MUST be
one of ``vcs_info`` (if ``url`` is a VCS reference), ``archive_info`` (if
``url`` is a source archives or a wheel), or ``dir_info`` (if ``url``  is a
local directory). These info fields have a (possibly empty) subdictionary as
value, with the possible keys defined below.

``url`` MUST be stripped of any sensitive authentication information,
for security reasons.

The user:password section of the URL MAY however
be composed of environment variables, matching the following regular
expression::

    \$\{[A-Za-z0-9-_]+\}(:\$\{[A-Za-z0-9-_]+\})?

Additionally, the user:password section of the URL MAY be a
well-known, non security sensitive string. A typical example is ``git``
in the case of an URL such as ``ssh://git@gitlab.com/user/repo``.

When ``url`` refers to a VCS repository, the ``vcs_info`` key MUST be present
as a dictionary with the following keys:

- A ``vcs`` key (type ``string``) MUST be present, containing the name of the VCS
  (i.e. one of ``git``, ``hg``, ``bzr``, ``svn``). Other VCS's SHOULD be registered by
  writing a PEP to amend this specification.
  The ``url`` value MUST be compatible with the corresponding VCS,
  so an installer can hand it off without transformation to a
  checkout/download command of the VCS.
- A ``requested_revision`` key (type ``string``) MAY be present naming a
  branch/tag/ref/commit/revision/etc (in a format compatible with the VCS)
  to install.
- A ``commit_id`` key (type ``string``) MUST be present, containing the
  exact commit/revision number that was installed.
  If the VCS supports commit-hash
  based revision identifiers, such commit-hash MUST be used as
  ``commit_id`` in order to reference the immutable
  version of the source code that was installed.

When ``url`` refers to a source archive or a wheel, the ``archive_info`` key
MUST be present as a dictionary with the following keys:

- A ``hashes`` key SHOULD be present as a dictionary mapping a hash name to a hex
  encoded digest of the file. 
  
  Multiple hashes can be included, and it is up to the consumer to decide what to do
  with multiple hashes (it may validate all of them or a subset of them, or nothing at
  all). 
  
  These hash names SHOULD always be normalized to be lowercase. 
  
  Any hash algorithm available via ``hashlib`` (specifically any that can be passed to
  ``hashlib.new()`` and do not require additional parameters) can be used as a key for
  the hashes dictionary. At least one secure algorithm from
  ``hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed`` SHOULD always be included. At time of writing,
  ``sha256`` specifically is recommended.
  
- A deprecated ``hash`` key (type ``string``) MAY be present for backwards compatibility
  purposes, with value ``<hash-algorithm>=<expected-hash>``.

Producers of the data structure SHOULD emit the ``hashes`` key whether one or multiple
hashes are available. Producers SHOULD continue to emit the ``hash`` key in contexts
where they did so before, so as to keep backwards compatibility for existing clients.

When both the ``hash`` and ``hashes`` keys are present, the hash represented in the
``hash`` key MUST also be present in the ``hashes`` dictionary, so consumers can
consider the ``hashes`` key only if it is present, and fall back to ``hash`` otherwise.

When ``url`` refers to a local directory, the ``dir_info`` key MUST be
present as a dictionary with the following key:

- ``editable`` (type: ``boolean``): ``true`` if the distribution was installed
  in editable mode, ``false`` otherwise. If absent, default to ``false``.

When ``url`` refers to a local directory, it MUST have the ``file`` sheme and
be compliant with :rfc:`8089`. In
particular, the path component must be absolute. Symbolic links SHOULD be
preserved when making relative paths absolute.

.. note::

  When the requested URL has the file:// scheme and points to a local directory that happens to contain a
  VCS checkout, installers MUST NOT attempt to infer any VCS information and
  therefore MUST NOT output any VCS related information (such as ``vcs_info``)
  in :file:`direct_url.json`.

A top-level ``subdirectory`` field MAY be present containing a directory path,
relative to the root of the VCS repository, source archive or local directory,
to specify where ``pyproject.toml`` or ``setup.py`` is located.

.. note::

   As a general rule, installers should as much as possible preserve the
   information that was provided in the requested URL when generating
   :file:`direct_url.json`. For example user:password environment variables
   should be preserved and ``requested_revision`` should reflect the revision that was
   provided in the requested URL as faithfully as possible. This information is
   however *enriched* with more precise data, such as ``commit_id``.

Registered VCS
==============

This section lists the registered VCS's; expanded, VCS-specific information
on how to use the ``vcs``, ``requested_revision``, and other fields of
``vcs_info``; and in
some cases additional VCS-specific fields.
Tools MAY support other VCS's although it is RECOMMENDED to register
them by writing a PEP to amend this specification. The ``vcs`` field SHOULD be the command name
(lowercased). Additional fields that would be necessary to
support such VCS SHOULD be prefixed with the VCS command name.

Git
---

Home page

   https://git-scm.com/

vcs command

   git

``vcs`` field

   git

``requested_revision`` field

   A tag name, branch name, Git ref, commit hash, shortened commit hash,
   or other commit-ish.

``commit_id`` field

   A commit hash (40 hexadecimal characters sha1).

.. note::

   Installers can use the ``git show-ref`` and ``git symbolic-ref`` commands
   to determine if the ``requested_revision`` corresponds to a Git ref.
   In turn, a ref beginning with ``refs/tags/`` corresponds to a tag, and
   a ref beginning with ``refs/remotes/origin/`` after cloning corresponds
   to a branch.

Mercurial
---------

Home page

   https://www.mercurial-scm.org/

vcs command

   hg

``vcs`` field

   hg

``requested_revision`` field

   A tag name, branch name, changeset ID, shortened changeset ID.

``commit_id`` field

   A changeset ID (40 hexadecimal characters).

Bazaar
------

Home page

   https://bazaar.canonical.com

vcs command

   bzr

``vcs`` field

   bzr

``requested_revision`` field

   A tag name, branch name, revision id.

``commit_id`` field

   A revision id.

Subversion
----------

Home page

   https://subversion.apache.org/

vcs command

   svn

``vcs`` field

   svn

``requested_revision`` field

   ``requested_revision`` must be compatible with ``svn checkout`` ``--revision`` option.
   In Subversion, branch or tag is part of ``url``.

``commit_id`` field

   Since Subversion does not support globally unique identifiers,
   this field is the Subversion revision number in the corresponding
   repository.

Examples
========

Example direct_url.json
-----------------------

Source archive:

.. code::

    {
        "url": "https://github.com/pypa/pip/archive/1.3.1.zip",
        "archive_info": {
            "hashes": {
                "sha256": "2dc6b5a470a1bde68946f263f1af1515a2574a150a30d6ce02c6ff742fcc0db8"
            }
        }
    }

Git URL with tag and commit-hash:

.. code::

    {
        "url": "https://github.com/pypa/pip.git",
        "vcs_info": {
            "vcs": "git",
            "requested_revision": "1.3.1",
            "commit_id": "7921be1537eac1e97bc40179a57f0349c2aee67d"
        }
    }

Local directory:

.. code::

   {
       "url": "file:///home/user/project",
       "dir_info": {}
   }

Local directory installed in editable mode:

.. code::

   {
       "url": "file:///home/user/project",
       "dir_info": {
           "editable": true
       }
   }


Example pip commands and their effect on direct_url.json
--------------------------------------------------------

Commands that generate a ``direct_url.json``:

* ``pip install https://example.com/app-1.0.tgz``
* ``pip install https://example.com/app-1.0.whl``
* ``pip install "app @ git+https://example.com/repo/app.git#subdirectory=setup"``
* ``pip install ./app``
* ``pip install file:///home/user/app``
* ``pip install --editable "app @ git+https://example.com/repo/app.git#subdirectory=setup"``
  (in which case, ``url`` will be the local directory where the git repository has been
  cloned to, and ``dir_info`` will be present with ``"editable": true`` and no
  ``vcs_info`` will be set)
* ``pip install -e ./app``

Commands that *do not* generate a ``direct_url.json``

* ``pip install app``
* ``pip install app --no-index --find-links https://example.com/``

History
=======

- March 2020: the ``direct_url.json`` metadata file was originally specified in
  :pep:`610` and is formally documented here.
- January 2023: Added the ``archive_info.hashes`` key
  (`discussion <https://discuss.python.org/t/22299>`__).
