==========================================================
Recording the Direct URL Origin of installed distributions
==========================================================

This document specifies a :file:`direct_url.json` file in the
:file:`*.dist-info` directory of an installed distribution, to record the
Direct URL Origin of the distribution. The layout of this file was originally
specified in :pep:`610` and is formally documented here.

Specification
=============

The :file:`direct_url.json` file MUST be created in the :file:`*.dist-info`
directory by installers when installing a distribution from a requirement
specifying a direct URL reference (including a VCS URL).

This file MUST NOT be created when installing a distribution from an other
type of requirement (i.e. name plus version specifier).

This JSON file MUST be a dictionary, compliant with :rfc:`8259` and UTF-8 encoded.

If present, it MUST contain at least two fields. The first one is ``url``, with
type ``string``. Depending on what ``url`` refers to, the second field MUST be
one of ``vcs_info`` (if ``url`` is a VCS reference), ``archive_info`` (if
``url`` is a source archives or a wheel), or ``dir_info`` (if ``url``  is a
local directory). These info fields have a (possibly empty) subdictionary as
value, with the possible keys defined below.

``url`` MUST be stripped of any sensitive authentication information,
for security reasons.

The user:password section of the URL MAY however
be composed of environment variables, matching the following regular
expression::

    \$\{[A-Za-z0-9-_]+\}(:\$\{[A-Za-z0-9-_]+\})?

Additionally, the user:password section of the URL MAY be a
well-known, non security sensitive string. A typical example is ``git``
in the case of an URL such as ``ssh://git@gitlab.com/user/repo``.

When ``url`` refers to a VCS repository, the ``vcs_info`` key MUST be present
as a dictionary with the following keys:

- A ``vcs`` key (type ``string``) MUST be present, containing the name of the VCS
  (i.e. one of ``git``, ``hg``, ``bzr``, ``svn``). Other VCS's SHOULD be registered by
  writing a PEP to amend this specification.
  The ``url`` value MUST be compatible with the corresponding VCS,
  so an installer can hand it off without transformation to a
  checkout/download command of the VCS.
- A ``requested_revision`` key (type ``string``) MAY be present naming a
  branch/tag/ref/commit/revision/etc (in a format compatible with the VCS)
  to install.
- A ``commit_id`` key (type ``string``) MUST be present, containing the
  exact commit/revision number that was installed.
  If the VCS supports commit-hash
  based revision identifiers, such commit-hash MUST be used as
  ``commit_id`` in order to reference the immutable
  version of the source code that was installed.

When ``url`` refers to a source archive or a wheel, the ``archive_info`` key
MUST be present as a dictionary with the following key:

- A ``hash`` key (type ``string``) SHOULD be present, with value
  ``<hash-algorithm>=<expected-hash>``.
  It is RECOMMENDED that only hashes which are unconditionally provided by
  the latest version of the standard library's ``hashlib`` module be used for
  source archive hashes. At time of writing, that list consists of 'md5',
  'sha1', 'sha224', 'sha256', 'sha384', and 'sha512'.

When ``url`` refers to a local directory, the ``dir_info`` key MUST be
present as a dictionary with the following key:

- ``editable`` (type: ``boolean``): ``true`` if the distribution was installed
  in editable mode, ``false`` otherwise. If absent, default to ``false``.

When ``url`` refers to a local directory, it MUST have the ``file`` sheme and
be compliant with :rfc:`8089`. In
particular, the path component must be absolute. Symbolic links SHOULD be
preserved when making relative paths absolute.

.. note::

  When the requested URL has the file:// scheme and points to a local directory that happens to contain a
  VCS checkout, installers MUST NOT attempt to infer any VCS information and
  therefore MUST NOT output any VCS related information (such as ``vcs_info``)
  in :file:`direct_url.json`.

A top-level ``subdirectory`` field MAY be present containing a directory path,
relative to the root of the VCS repository, source archive or local directory,
to specify where ``pyproject.toml`` or ``setup.py`` is located.

.. note::

   As a general rule, installers should as much as possible preserve the
   information that was provided in the requested URL when generating
   :file:`direct_url.json`. For example user:password environment variables
   should be preserved and ``requested_revision`` should reflect the revision that was
   provided in the requested URL as faithfully as possible. This information is
   however *enriched* with more precise data, such as ``commit_id``.

Registered VCS
==============

This section lists the registered VCS's; expanded, VCS-specific information
on how to use the ``vcs``, ``requested_revision``, and other fields of
``vcs_info``; and in
some cases additional VCS-specific fields.
Tools MAY support other VCS's although it is RECOMMENDED to register
them by writing a PEP to amend this specification. The ``vcs`` field SHOULD be the command name
(lowercased). Additional fields that would be necessary to
support such VCS SHOULD be prefixed with the VCS command name.

Git
---

Home page

   https://git-scm.com/

vcs command

   git

``vcs`` field

   git

``requested_revision`` field

   A tag name, branch name, Git ref, commit hash, shortened commit hash,
   or other commit-ish.

``commit_id`` field

   A commit hash (40 hexadecimal characters sha1).

.. note::

   Installers can use the ``git show-ref`` and ``git symbolic-ref`` commands
   to determine if the ``requested_revision`` corresponds to a Git ref.
   In turn, a ref beginning with ``refs/tags/`` corresponds to a tag, and
   a ref beginning with ``refs/remotes/origin/`` after cloning corresponds
   to a branch.

Mercurial
---------

Home page

   https://www.mercurial-scm.org/

vcs command

   hg

``vcs`` field

   hg

``requested_revision`` field

   A tag name, branch name, changeset ID, shortened changeset ID.

``commit_id`` field

   A changeset ID (40 hexadecimal characters).

Bazaar
------

Home page

   https://bazaar.canonical.com

vcs command

   bzr

``vcs`` field

   bzr

``requested_revision`` field

   A tag name, branch name, revision id.

``commit_id`` field

   A revision id.

Subversion
----------

Home page

   https://subversion.apache.org/

vcs command

   svn

``vcs`` field

   svn

``requested_revision`` field

   ``requested_revision`` must be compatible with ``svn checkout`` ``--revision`` option.
   In Subversion, branch or tag is part of ``url``.

``commit_id`` field

   Since Subversion does not support globally unique identifiers,
   this field is the Subversion revision number in the corresponding
   repository.

Examples
========

Example direct_url.json
-----------------------

Source archive:

.. code::

    {
        "url": "https://github.com/pypa/pip/archive/1.3.1.zip",
        "archive_info": {
            "hash": "sha256=2dc6b5a470a1bde68946f263f1af1515a2574a150a30d6ce02c6ff742fcc0db8"
        }
    }

Git URL with tag and commit-hash:

.. code::

    {
        "url": "https://github.com/pypa/pip.git",
        "vcs_info": {
            "vcs": "git",
            "requested_revision": "1.3.1",
            "commit_id": "7921be1537eac1e97bc40179a57f0349c2aee67d"
        }
    }

Local directory:

.. code::

   {
       "url": "file:///home/user/project",
       "dir_info": {}
   }

Local directory installed in editable mode:

.. code::

   {
       "url": "file:///home/user/project",
       "dir_info": {
           "editable": true
       }
   }


Example pip commands and their effect on direct_url.json
--------------------------------------------------------

Commands that generate a ``direct_url.json``:

* ``pip install https://example.com/app-1.0.tgz``
* ``pip install https://example.com/app-1.0.whl``
* ``pip install "git+https://example.com/repo/app.git#egg=app&subdirectory=setup"``
* ``pip install ./app``
* ``pip install file:///home/user/app``
* ``pip install --editable "git+https://example.com/repo/app.git#egg=app&subdirectory=setup"``
  (in which case, ``url`` will be the local directory where the git repository has been
  cloned to, and ``dir_info`` will be present with ``"editable": true`` and no
  ``vcs_info`` will be set)
* ``pip install -e ./app``

Commands that *do not* generate a ``direct_url.json``

* ``pip install app``
* ``pip install app --no-index --find-links https://example.com/``
