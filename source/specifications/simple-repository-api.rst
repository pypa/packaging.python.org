=====================
Simple repository API
=====================

The simple repository API is an HTTP-based protocol for tools to list and
download Python :term:`packages <Distribution Package>`. It is the API which
:term:`package indexes <Package Index>` implement to provide package managers
(for example, :ref:`pip`) enough information to determine what to install for a
given set of :term:`requirements <Requirement>`, then go on to install those
packages.

There is one version series for the API: version 1. Minor versions add optional
features, and are described below.

The API consists of two endpoints: listing :term:`projects <Project>` available
in the index, and listing package files for (and some other details of) a given
project. These endpoints are provided as responses from an HTTP server.

There are two representations of responses from the API: HTML and JSON. Apart
from optional features, these representations provide the same information.

Specification
=============

.. collapse:: OpenAPI

   An `OpenAPI <https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0>`_ document which
   specifies the full API. It declares both representations, but only details
   the JSON format's schema.

   .. literalinclude:: simple-repository-api.openapi.yml
      :language: yaml

API version scheme
##################

The version of the API is a version number which follows the :ref:`version
specifier specification <version-specifiers>` as only ``Major.Minor``.

Incrementing the major version is used to signal a backwards incompatible
change such that existing clients would no longer be expected to be able to
meaningfully use the API.

Incrementing the minor version is used to signal a backwards compatible change
such that existing clients would still be expected to be able to meaningfully
use the API.

Clients should introspect each response for the repository version, and must
assume version 1.0 if missing. If the major version is greater than expected,
clients must fail with an appropriate error message for the user. If the minor
version is greater than expected, clients should warn the user with an
appropriate message. Clients may continue to use feature detection.

Representations
###############

The index server can respond with one of two different representation formats
for each endpoint [#f2]_:

* `HTML5`_: content-type ``application/vnd.pypi.simple.v1+html``

  * Clients can also request ``application/vnd.pypi.simple.latest+html``

* `JSON`_: content-type ``application/vnd.pypi.simple.v1+json``

  * Clients can also request ``application/vnd.pypi.simple.latest+json``

  * ``text/html`` is an alias for this content-type

Content negotiation
-------------------

The representation can be selected by the client through the use of `HTTP
content negotiation
<https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-content-negotiation>`_.

To request one of these representations, the `Accept
<https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-accept>`_ header should be
set in requests to one of the above content-type values. If this header is
missing, the index server assumes it to be ``*/*``.

Responses from the index server should have the corresponding `Content-Type
<https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#field.content-type>`_ header for the
representation provided. If ``latest`` was requested by the client, then ``v1``
must be returned by the index server.

If a representation can't be selected from the client's request, then the index
server can do one of:

* Select a default content type other than what the client has requested and
  return a response with that.

* Return a HTTP 406 Not Acceptable response to indicate that none of the
  requested content types were available, and the server was unable or
  unwilling to select a default content type to respond with.

* Return a HTTP 300 Multiple Choices response that contains a list of all of
  the possible responses that could have been chosen. This option is not
  encouraged as there is no standard format for this list.

Clients should be prepared to handle all possible responses.

URL parameter
-------------

This method takes precedence over content negotiation. Index servers may
optionally support this method, or respond with an error if present, and
clients should not rely on it.

A ``format`` URL parameter can be specified, with value equal to one of the
above content-type values. If the index server does not support the value, it
may fall back to content negotiation.

Endpoint configuration
----------------------

This method is simply a suggestion, and is not standardised. Servers could
configure different base URLs to serve the different representations.

Endpoints
#########

The API consists of two metadata endpoints:

* :ref:`simple-repository-api-projects-list`
* :ref:`simple-repository-api-project-details`

The root URL ``/`` represents the base URL, where it would be prefixed with
the index's URL to construct the full URL which tools make the request for.

If a client makes a request to a URL without a trailing forward-slash ``/``,
then the index server should redirect the client to the same URL with the ``/``
appended.

.. _simple-repository-api-projects-list:

Projects list
-------------

URL: ``/``, the root URL

This endpoint returns a list of all of the :term:`projects <Project>` provided
by the index, with each list item containing the project's name. This list is
not necessarily ordered.

HTML representation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The response from the index is a valid `HTML5`_ page.

A `metadata element`_ ``<meta>`` may exist anywhere in the HTML document, with
``name`` attribute value equal to the string ``pypi:repository-version``, and
``content`` attribute value equal the API version which the response
implements.

Each project provided by the index has a corresponding `anchor element`_
``<a>``:

* Its body text must exist and is the name of the project (not necessarily
  :ref:`normalized <name-normalization>`).

* Its ``href`` attribute must exist and is a URL to the :ref:`project details
  <simple-repository-api-project-details>` page for the project. This URL must
  end with a forward-slash ``/``, but may be absolute or relative.

An example response page:

.. code-block:: html

   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
     <head>
       <meta name="pypi:repository-version" content="1.0">
       <title>Projects</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <a href="/frob/">frob</a>
       <a href="/spamspamspam/">spamspamspam</a>
     </body>
   </html>

JSON representation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The response from the index is a valid `JSON`_ document. This document
represents an object with properties:

* ``meta`` (object, required) - response metadata; has properties:

  * ``api-version`` (string, required) - the API version the response
    implements.

* ``projects`` (array of objects, required) - projects list. Each project
  provided by the index corresponds to an element in this array, and vice
  versa. Objects have properties:

  * ``name`` (required) - the project's name (not necessarily :ref:`normalized
    <name-normalization>`), as a string.

Unknown JSON object keys must be ignored.

An example response document:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "meta": {
       "api-version": "1.0"
     },
     "projects": [
       {"name": "Frob"},
       {"name": "spamspamspam"}
     ]
   }

.. _simple-repository-api-project-details:

Project details
---------------

URL: ``/<project>/``, where ``<project>`` is replaced with the :ref:`normalized
name <name-normalization>` of the project.

This endpoint returns some metadata of the :term:`project <Project>`, along
with a list of all :term:`package files <Distribution Package>` provided by the
index for the project. This list of files is not necessarily ordered.

If a client uses an unnormalized name for ``<project>``, the index server may
redirect to the URL with the normalized name. Conformant client must always
make requests with normalized names.

API file-related features:

* The file can be hosted anywhere, not necessarily by the index server.

* The file's URL in the list-item is a URL to fetch the file. It may be
  absolute or relative. Its last path segment must be the file's filename.

* Hashes of the file's contents are optional but recommended. The hash name is
  the name of the hash algorithm's function, and the value is the hex-encoded
  digest hash. The function should be one in the standard-library
  :external+python:mod:`hashlib` module, and
  :external+python:func:`hashlib.sha256` is preferred.

* A `GPG signature <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4880.html#section-2.2>`_
  for the file can be accessed at the same URL as the file but with ``.asc``
  appended, if it is provided. For example, the file at
  ``/packages/HolyGrail-1.0.tar.gz`` may have a signature at
  ``/packages/HolyGrail-1.0.tar.gz.asc``.

* The file's :ref:`core-metadata-requires-python` metadata field may be
  provided. Clients should ignore the file when installing to an environment
  for a version of Python which doesn't satisfy the requirement.

* Files may be marked as :ref:`yanked <simple-repository-api-yanked>`.

* The file's :ref:`Core Metadata <core-metadata>` must be provided if its
  existence is indicated (by one of the representation-specific mechanisms
  described below). In addition, the file must contain this metadata which will
  not be modified when the distribution is processed and/or installed.

  The metadata must be accessed at the same URL as the file but with
  ``.metadata`` appended. For example, the file at
  ``/files/distribution-1.0-py3.none.any.whl`` may have its metadata at
  ``/files/distribution-1.0-py3.none.any.whl.metadata``.

  The index should also provide a hash of the metadata.

HTML representation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The response from the index is a valid `HTML5`_ page.

A `metadata element`_ ``<meta>`` may exist anywhere in the HTML document, with
``name`` attribute value equal to the string ``pypi:repository-version``, and
``content`` attribute value equal the API version which the response
implements.

Each distribution package file provided by the index for the project has a
corresponding `anchor element`_ ``<a>``:

* Its body text must exist and is the file's filename.

* Its ``href`` attribute must exist and is the file's URL.

  * This URL should also include a URL fragment of the form
    ``#<hash>=<value>``, where ``<hash>`` is the hash name and ``<value>`` is
    hash value.

* A ``data-gpg-sig`` `data attribute`_ may exist, and have value ``true`` to
  indicate a file has a GPG signature (at the location described above), or
  ``false`` to indicate no signature. Indexes should do this for none or all
  files (not some).

* A ``data-requires-python`` `data attribute`_ may exist, and have value equal
  to the :ref:`core-metadata-requires-python` metadata field for the file's
  release, with HTML-encoding (less-than ``<`` becomes the string ``&lt;``, and
  greater-than ``>`` becomes the string ``&gt;``).

* A ``data-yanked`` `data attribute`_ may exist to indicate the file was
  :ref:`yanked <simple-repository-api-yanked>`. The attribute may have a value
  which specifies the reason the file is yanked.

* A ``data-core-metadata`` `data attribute`_ may exist to indicate the index
  provides the file's core-metadata. The attribute's value should be of the
  form ``<hash>=<value>``, where ``<hash>`` is the hash name and ``<value>`` is
  hash value; otherwise, the value may the string ``true``, or not provided, if
  the metadata's hash is not available.

  This attribute may be duplicated as the `data attribute`_
  ``data-dist-info-metadata``.

An example response page:

.. code-block:: html

   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
     <head>
       <meta name="pypi:repository-version" content="1.0">
       <title>Foo</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <a href="/foo/foo-1.0.0.tar.gz">foo-1.0.0.tar.gz</a>
       <a
         href="/foo/foo-1.0.1.tar.gz#sha256=abcd1234"
         data-gpg-sig="true"
         data-requires-python="&gt;=3.12"
         data-yanked="Too much bar"
         data-core-metadata="sha256=abcd1234"
       >foo-1.0.1.tar.gz</a>
     </body>
   </html>

JSON representation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The response from the index is a valid `JSON`_ document. This document
represents an object with properties:

* ``meta`` (object, required) - response metadata; has properties:

  * ``api-version`` (string, required) - the API version the response
    implements.

* ``name`` (string, required) - the :ref:`normalized <name-normalization>` name
  of the project.

* ``versions`` (array of strings, required) - all of the project versions
  uploaded for this project. It must not contain duplicates, and the order is
  not significant. All files must be associated with a version in this array,
  but not all versions need files associated. These versions should be
  :ref:`normalized <version-specifiers-normalization>`.

  .. versionadded:: 1.1

* ``files`` (array of objects, required) - files list. Each file provided by
  the index for the project corresponds to an element in this array, and vice
  versa. Objects have properties:

  * ``filename`` (string, required) - the file's filename

  * ``url`` (string, required) - the file's URL

  * ``hashes`` (object, required) - the file's hashes. Its keys are the hash
    names, and the values are the corresponding hash values. Should contain at
    least one hash.

  * ``gpg-sig`` (boolean, optional) - indicates whether the index provides the
    file's GPG signature.

    If this key is missing, the signature may or may not be available.

  * ``requires-python`` (string, optional) - the
    :ref:`core-metadata-requires-python` metadata field for the file's release.

  * ``yanked`` (boolean or string, optional) - indicates whether the file
    should be considered :ref:`yanked <simple-repository-api-yanked>` (if
    truthy, using Python :external+python:ref:`truthiness <booleans>`) or not
    (if falsy).

    If this is a string, then it specifies the reason for being yanked.

  * ``core-metadata`` (boolean or object, optional) - indicates whether the
    index provide's the file's :ref:`Core Metadata <core-metadata>` (if truthy,
    using Python :external+python:ref:`truthiness <booleans>`) or
    not (if falsy).

    If this is an object, then it contains hashes of the metadata, in the same
    form as the ``hashes`` file-object key.

    If this key is missing, the metadata may or may not be available.

  * ``size`` (number, required) - file size in integer bytes.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1

  * ``upload-time`` (string, optional) - file upload time, as an ISO 8601
    date/time string in the UTC timezone using a ``Z`` suffix with precision
    between seconds and microseconds: in the format
    ``YYYY-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS.ffffffZ`` (number of ``f``'s variable).

    .. versionadded:: 1.1

Unknown JSON object keys must be ignored.

An example response document:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "meta": {
       "api-version": "1.0"
     },
     "name": "foo",
     "files": [
       {"filename": "foo-1.0.0.tar.gz", "url": "/foo/foo-1.0.0.tar.gz"},
       {
         "filename": "foo-1.0.1.tar.gz",
         "url": "/foo/foo-1.0.1.tar.gz",
         "gpg-sig": true,
         "requires-python": ">=3.12",
         "yanked": "Too much bar",
         "core-metadata": {"sha256": "abcd1234"}
       }
     ]
   }

.. _simple-repository-api-yanked:

Yanked files
############

A yanked :term:`package file <Distribution Package>` is one intended to be
now-unavailable for installation from the index. The file's yank status can be
changed at anypoint (to be unyanked, or even yanked again).

Indexes may provide a textual reason for why the file has been yanked, and
clients may display that reason to end-users.

Installers must ignore yanked :term:`releases <Release>` if a non-yanked
release satisfies the :term:`requirement <Requirement>`. Installers may refuse
to install a yanked release and not install anything. Installers should follow
the spirit of the intention of yanked files [#f1]_ and prevent new dependencies
on yanked releases and files.

Installers should emit a warning if they decide to install a yanked file. That
warning may utilize the reason for the yanking.

What this means is left up to the specific installer, to decide how to best fit
into the overall usage of their installer. However, there are two suggested
approaches to take:

* Yanked files are always ignored, unless they are the only file that matches a
  version specifier that “pins” to an exact version using either ``==``
  (without any modifiers that make it a range, such as ``.*``) or ``===``.
  Matching this version specifier should otherwise be done as per the]
  :ref:`version specifier specification <version-specifiers>` for things
  like local versions, zero padding, etc.

* Yanked files are always ignored, unless they are the only file that matches
  what a lock file (such as Pipfile.lock or poetry.lock) specifies to be
  installed. In this case, a yanked file SHOULD not be used when creating or
  updating a lock file from some input file or command.

Mirror indexes may omit list items for yanked files in their responses to
clients, or may include list items for yanked files along with their
yank status (this status must be present for yanked files).

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f2] The format of this content type follows
   ``application/vnd.pypi.simple.$version+format``, where ``$version`` is the
   major version of the API prefixed with ``v``.

.. [#f1] The desirable experience for users is that once a file is yanked, when
   a human being is currently trying to directly install a yanked file, that it
   fails as if that file had been deleted. However, when a human did that
   awhile ago, and now a computer is just continuing to mechanically follow the
   original order to install the now yanked file, then it acts as if it had not
   been yanked.
