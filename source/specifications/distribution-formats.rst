Distribution formats
====================


Source distribution format
==========================

The source distribution format (``sdist``) is not currently formally defined.
Instead, its format is implicitly defined by the behaviour of the
standard library's ``distutils`` module when executing the ``setup.py sdist``
command.


Binary distribution format
==========================

The binary distribution format (``wheel``) is defined in :pep:`427`.
