Platform Compatibility Tags
===========================

The platform compatibility tagging model used for ``wheel`` distribution is
defined in :pep:`425`.

The scheme defined in that PEP is insufficient for public distribution
of Linux wheel files (and \*nix wheel files in general), so :pep:`513` was
created to define the ``manylinux1`` tag.
