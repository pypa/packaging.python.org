.. note:: This specification was originally defined in :pep:`740`.

.. note::

    :pep:`740` includes changes to the HTML and JSON index APIs.
    These changes are documented in the :ref:`simple-repository-api`
    under :ref:`simple-repository-api-base` and :ref:`json-serialization`.

.. _upload-endpoint:

Upload endpoint changes
-----------------------

.. important::

    The "legacy" upload API is not standardized.
    See `PyPI's Upload API documentation <https://docs.pypi.org/api/upload/>`_
    for how attestations are uploaded.

.. _attestation-object:

Attestation objects
-------------------

An attestation object is a JSON object with several required keys; applications
or signers may include additional keys so long as all explicitly
listed keys are provided. The required layout of an attestation
object is provided as pseudocode below.

.. code-block:: python

  @dataclass
  class Attestation:
      version: Literal[1]
      """
      The attestation object's version, which is always 1.
      """

      verification_material: VerificationMaterial
      """
      Cryptographic materials used to verify `envelope`.
      """

      envelope: Envelope
      """
      The enveloped attestation statement and signature.
      """


  @dataclass
  class Envelope:
      statement: bytes
      """
      The attestation statement.

      This is represented as opaque bytes on the wire (encoded as base64),
      but it MUST be an JSON in-toto v1 Statement.
      """

      signature: bytes
      """
      A signature for the above statement, encoded as base64.
      """

  @dataclass
  class VerificationMaterial:
      certificate: str
      """
      The signing certificate, as `base64(DER(cert))`.
      """

      transparency_entries: list[object]
      """
      One or more transparency log entries for this attestation's signature
      and certificate.
      """

      timestamps: list[bytes] | None
      """
      Optional list of base64 encoded RFC3161 timestamp responses. Timestamps
      are optional if `transparency_entries` only contains entries with an
      integrated_time.
      """

A full data model for each object in ``transparency_entries`` is provided in
:ref:`appendix`. Attestation objects **SHOULD** include one or more
transparency log entries, and **MAY** include additional keys for other
sources of signed time (such as an :rfc:`3161` Time Stamping Authority or a
`Roughtime <https://blog.cloudflare.com/roughtime>`__ server).

Attestation objects are versioned; this PEP specifies version 1. Each version
is tied to a single cryptographic suite to minimize unnecessary cryptographic
agility. In version 1, the suite is as follows:

* Certificates are specified as X.509 certificates, and comply with the
  profile in :rfc:`5280`.
* The message signature algorithm is ECDSA, with the P-256 curve for public keys
  and SHA-256 as the cryptographic digest function.

Future PEPs may change this suite (and the overall shape of the attestation
object) by selecting a new version number.

.. _payload-and-signature-generation:

Attestation statement and signature generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *attestation statement* is the actual claim that is cryptographically signed
over within the attestation object (i.e., the ``envelope.statement``).

The attestation statement is encoded as a
`v1 in-toto Statement object <https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/v1.0/spec/v1.0/statement.md>`__,
in JSON form. When serialized the statement is treated as an opaque binary blob,
avoiding the need for canonicalization.

In addition to being a v1 in-toto Statement, the attestation statement is constrained
in the following ways:

* The in-toto ``subject`` **MUST** contain only a single subject.
* ``subject[0].name`` is the distribution's filename, which **MUST** be
  a valid :ref:`source distribution <source-distribution-format>` or
  :ref:`wheel distribution <binary-distribution-format>` filename.
* ``subject[0].digest`` **MUST** contain a SHA-256 digest. Other digests
  **MAY** be present. The digests **MUST** be represented as hexadecimal strings.
* The following ``predicateType`` values are supported:

  * `SLSA Provenance <https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1>`__: ``https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1``
  * `PyPI Publish Attestation <https://docs.pypi.org/attestations/publish/v1>`__: ``https://docs.pypi.org/attestations/publish/v1``

The signature over this statement is constructed using the
`v1 DSSE signature protocol <https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/dsse/blob/v1.0.0/protocol.md>`__,
with a ``PAYLOAD_TYPE`` of ``application/vnd.in-toto+json`` and a ``PAYLOAD_BODY`` of the JSON-encoded
statement above. No other ``PAYLOAD_TYPE`` is permitted.

.. _provenance-object:

Provenance objects
------------------

The index will serve uploaded attestations along with metadata that can assist
in verifying them in the form of JSON serialized objects.

These *provenance objects* will be available via both the Simple Index
and JSON-based Simple API as described above, and will have the following layout:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": 1,
        "attestation_bundles": [
          {
            "publisher": {
              "kind": "important-ci-service",
              "claims": {},
              "vendor-property": "foo",
              "another-property": 123
            },
            "attestations": [
              { /* attestation 1 ... */ },
              { /* attestation 2 ... */ }
            ]
          }
        ]
    }

or, as pseudocode:

.. code-block:: python

  @dataclass
  class Publisher:
      kind: string
      """
      The kind of Trusted Publisher.
      """

      claims: object | None
      """
      Any context-specific claims retained by the index during Trusted Publisher
      authentication.
      """

      _rest: object
      """
      Each publisher object is open-ended, meaning that it MAY contain additional
      fields beyond the ones specified explicitly above. This field signals that,
      but is not itself present.
      """

  @dataclass
  class AttestationBundle:
      publisher: Publisher
      """
      The publisher associated with this set of attestations.
      """

      attestations: list[Attestation]
      """
      The set of attestations included in this bundle.
      """

  @dataclass
  class Provenance:
      version: Literal[1]
      """
      The provenance object's version, which is always 1.
      """

      attestation_bundles: list[AttestationBundle]
      """
      One or more attestation "bundles".
      """

* ``version`` is ``1``. Like attestation objects, provenance objects are
  versioned, and this PEP only defines version ``1``.
* ``attestation_bundles`` is a **required** JSON array, containing one
  or more "bundles" of attestations. Each bundle corresponds to a
  signing identity (such as a Trusted Publishing identity), and contains
  one or more attestation objects.

  As noted in the ``Publisher`` model,
  each ``AttestationBundle.publisher`` object is specific to its Trusted Publisher
  but must include at minimum:

  * A ``kind`` key, which **MUST** be a JSON string that uniquely identifies the
    kind of Trusted Publisher.
  * A ``claims`` key, which **MUST** be a JSON object containing any context-specific
    claims retained by the index during Trusted Publisher authentication.

  All other keys in the publisher object are publisher-specific.

  Each array of attestation objects is a superset of the ``attestations``
  array supplied by the uploaded through the ``attestations`` field at upload
  time, as described in :ref:`upload-endpoint` and
  :ref:`changes-to-provenance-objects`.

.. _changes-to-provenance-objects:

Changes to provenance objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Provenance objects are *not* immutable, and may change over time. Reasons
for changes to the provenance object include but are not limited to:

* Addition of new attestations for a pre-existing signing identity: the index
  **MAY** choose to allow additional attestations by pre-existing signing
  identities, such as newer attestation versions for already uploaded
  files.

* Addition of new signing identities and associated attestations: the index
  **MAY** choose to support attestations from sources other than the file's
  uploader, such as third-party auditors or the index itself. These attestations
  may be performed asynchronously, requiring the index to insert them into
  the provenance object *post facto*.

.. _attestation-verification:

Attestation verification
------------------------

Verifying an attestation object against a distribution file requires verification of each of the
following:

* ``version`` is ``1``. The verifier **MUST** reject any other version.
* ``verification_material.certificate`` is a valid signing certificate, as
  issued by an *a priori* trusted authority (such as a root of trust already
  present within the verifying client).
* ``verification_material.certificate`` identifies an appropriate signing
  subject, such as the machine identity of the Trusted Publisher that published
  the package.
* ``envelope.statement`` is a valid in-toto v1 Statement, with a subject
  and digest that **MUST** match the distribution's filename and contents.
  For the distribution's filename, matching **MUST** be performed by parsing
  using the appropriate source distribution or wheel filename format, as
  the statement's subject may be equivalent but normalized.
* ``envelope.signature`` is a valid signature for ``envelope.statement``
  corresponding to ``verification_material.certificate``,
  as reconstituted via the
  `v1 DSSE signature protocol <https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/dsse/blob/v1.0.0/protocol.md>`__.

In addition to the above required steps, a verifier **MAY** additionally verify
``verification_material.transparency_entries`` on a policy basis, e.g. requiring
at least one transparency log entry or a threshold of entries. When verifying
transparency entries, the verifier **MUST** confirm that the inclusion time for
each entry lies within the signing certificate's validity period: Inclusion time
is either embedded in the entry (``integrated_time``) or provided as RFC3161
timestamp in ``verification_material.timestamps``.

.. _appendix:

Appendix: Data models for Transparency Log Entries
====================================================

This appendix contains pseudocoded data models for transparency log entries
in attestation objects. Each transparency log entry serves as a source
of signed inclusion time, and can be verified either online or offline.

.. code-block:: python

  @dataclass
  class TransparencyLogEntry:
      log_index: int
      """
      The global index of the log entry, used when querying the log.
      """

      log_id: str
      """
      An opaque, unique identifier for the log.
      """

      entry_kind: str
      """
      The kind (type) of log entry.
      """

      entry_version: str
      """
      The version of the log entry's submitted format.
      """

      integrated_time: int
      """
      The UNIX timestamp from the log from when the entry was persisted.
      """

      inclusion_proof: InclusionProof
      """
      The actual inclusion proof of the log entry.

      """
      The index of the entry in the tree it was written to.
      """

      """
      The digest stored at the root of the Merkle tree at the time of proof
      generation.
      """

      tree_size: int
      """
      The size of the Merkle tree at the time of proof generation.
      """

      hashes: list[str]
      """
      A list of hashes required to complete the inclusion proof, sorted
      in order from leaf to root. The leaf and root hashes are not themselves
      included in this list; the root is supplied via `root_hash` and the client
      must calculate the leaf hash.
      """

      checkpoint: str
      """
      The signed tree head's signature, at the time of proof generation.
