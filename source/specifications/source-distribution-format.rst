==========================
Source distribution format
==========================

The current standard source distribution format is identified by the
presence of a :file:`pyproject.toml` file in the distribution archive.  The layout
of such a distribution was originally specified in :pep:`517` and is formally
documented here.

There is also the legacy source distribution format, implicitly defined by the
behaviour of ``distutils`` module in the standard library, when executing
:command:`setup.py sdist`. This document does not attempt to standardise this
format, except to note that if a legacy source distribution contains a
``PKG-INFO`` file using metadata version 2.2 or later, then it MUST follow
the rules applicable to source distributions defined in the metadata
specification.

Source distributions are also known as *sdists* for short.

.. _source-distribution-format-source-tree:

Source trees
============

A *source tree* is a collection of files and directories -- like a version
control system checkout -- which contains a :file:`pyproject.toml` file that
can be used to build a source distribution from the contained files and
directories. :pep:`517` and :pep:`518` specify what is required to meet the
definition of what :file:`pyproject.toml` must contain for something to be
deemed a source tree.

.. _source-distribution-format-sdist:

Source distribution file name
=============================

The file name of a sdist was standardised in :pep:`625`. The file name must be in
the form ``{name}-{version}.tar.gz``, where ``{name}`` is normalised according to
the same rules as for binary distributions (see :ref:`binary-distribution-format`),
and ``{version}`` is the canonicalized form of the project version (see
:ref:`version-specifiers`).

The name and version components of the filename MUST match the values stored
in the metadata contained in the file.

Code that produces a source distribution file MUST give the file a name that matches
this specification. This includes the ``build_sdist`` hook of a
:term:`build backend <Build Backend>`.

Code that processes source distribution files MAY recognise source distribution files
by the ``.tar.gz`` suffix and the presence of precisely *one* hyphen in the filename.
Code that does this may then use the distribution name and version from the filename
without further verification.

Source distribution file format
===============================

A ``.tar.gz`` source distribution (sdist) contains a single top-level directory
called ``{name}-{version}`` (e.g. ``foo-1.0``), containing the source files of
the package. The name and version MUST match the metadata stored in the file.
This directory must also contain a :file:`pyproject.toml` in the format defined in
:ref:`pyproject-toml-spec`, and a :file:`PKG-INFO` file containing
metadata in the format described in the :ref:`core-metadata` specification. The
metadata MUST conform to at least version 2.2 of the metadata specification.

If the metadata version is 2.4 or greater, the source distribution MUST contain
any license files specified by the ``License-File`` field in the :file:`PKG-INFO`
at their respective paths relative to the root directory of the sdist
(containing the :file:`pyproject.toml` and the :file:`PKG-INFO` metadata).

No other content of a sdist is required or defined. Build systems can store
whatever information they need in the sdist to build the project.

The tarball should use the modern POSIX.1-2001 pax tar format, which specifies
UTF-8 based file names. In particular, source distribution files must be readable
using the standard library tarfile module with the open flag 'r:gz'.


.. _sdist-archive-features:

Source distribution archive features
====================================

Because extracting tar files as-is is dangerous, and the results are
platform-specific, archive features of source distributions are limited.

Unpacking with the data filter
------------------------------

When extracting a source distribution, tools MUST either use
:py:func:`tarfile.data_filter` (e.g. :py:meth:`TarFile.extractall(..., filter='data') <tarfile.TarFile.extractall>`), OR
follow the *Unpacking without the data filter* section below.

As an exception, on Python interpreters without :py:func:`hasattr(tarfile, 'data_filter') <tarfile.data_filter>`
(:pep:`706`), tools that normally use that filter (directly on indirectly)
MAY warn the user and ignore this specification.
The trade-off between usability (e.g. fully trusting the archive) and
security (e.g. refusing to unpack) is left up to the tool in this case.


Unpacking without the data filter
---------------------------------

Tools that do not use the ``data`` filter directly (e.g. for backwards
compatibility, allowing additional features, or not using Python) MUST follow
this section.
(At the time of this writing, the ``data`` filter also follows this section,
but it may get out of sync in the future.)

The following files are invalid in an *sdist* archive.
Upon encountering such an entry, tools SHOULD notify the user,
MUST NOT unpack the entry, and MAY abort with a failure:

- Files that would be placed outside the destination directory.
- Links (symbolic or hard) pointing outside the destination directory.
- Device files (including pipes).

The following are also invalid. Tools MAY treat them as above,
but are NOT REQUIRED to do so:

- Files with a ``..`` component in the filename or link target.
- Links pointing to a file that is not part of the archive.

Tools MAY unpack links (symbolic or hard) as regular files,
using content from the archive.

When extracting *sdist* archives:

- Leading slashes in file names MUST be dropped.
  (This is nowadays standard behaviour for ``tar`` unpacking.)
- For each ``mode`` (Unix permission) bit, tools MUST either:

  - use the platform's default for a new file/directory (respectively),
  - set the bit according to the archive, or
  - use the bit from ``rw-r--r--`` (``0o644``) for non-executable files or
    ``rwxr-xr-x`` (``0o755``) for executable files and directories.

- High ``mode`` bits (setuid, setgid, sticky) MUST be cleared.
- It is RECOMMENDED to preserve the user *executable* bit.


Further hints
-------------

Tool authors are encouraged to consider how *hints for further
verification* in ``tarfile`` documentation apply to their tool.
