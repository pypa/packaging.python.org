Using TestPyPI
==============

``TestPyPI`` is a separate instance of the :term:`Python Package Index (PyPI)`
that allows you to try out the distribution tools and process without worrying
about affecting the real index. TestPyPI is hosted at
`test.pypi.org <https://test.pypi.org>`_

Registering your account
------------------------

Because TestPyPI has a separate database from the live PyPI, you'll need a
separate user account specifically for TestPyPI. Go to
https://test.pypi.org/account/register/ to register your account.

.. note:: The database for TestPyPI may be periodically pruned, so it is not
    unusual for user accounts to be deleted.


Using TestPyPI with Twine
-------------------------

You can upload your distributions to TestPyPI using :ref:`twine` by specifying
the ``--repository`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

    twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

You can see if your package has successfully uploaded by navigating to the URL
``https://test.pypi.org/project/<sampleproject>`` where ``sampleproject`` is
the name of your project that you uploaded. It may take a minute or two for
your project to appear on the site.

Using TestPyPI with pip
-----------------------

You can tell :ref:`pip` to download packages from TestPyPI instead of PyPI by
specifying the ``--index-url`` flag:

.. tab:: Unix/macOS

    .. code-block:: bash

        python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ your-package

.. tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: bat

        py -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ your-package

If you want to allow pip to also download packages from PyPI, you can
specify ``--extra-index-url`` to point to PyPI. This is useful when the package
you're testing has dependencies:

.. tab:: Unix/macOS

    .. code-block:: bash

        python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ your-package

.. tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: bat

        py -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ your-package

Setting up TestPyPI in :file:`.pypirc`
--------------------------------------

If you want to avoid entering your username, you can configure TestPyPI in
your :file:`$HOME/.pypirc`:

.. code::

    [testpypi]
    username = <your TestPyPI username>

For more details, see the :ref:`specification <pypirc>` for :file:`.pypirc`.
