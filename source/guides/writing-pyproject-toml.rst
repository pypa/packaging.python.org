.. _writing-pyproject-toml:

===============================
Writing your ``pyproject.toml``
===============================

``pyproject.toml`` is a configuration file used by packaging tools, as
well as other tools such as linters, type checkers, etc. There are
three possible TOML tables in this file.

- The ``[build-system]`` table is **strongly recommended**. It allows
  you to declare which :term:`build backend` you use and which other
  dependencies are needed to build your project.

- The ``[project]`` table is the format that most build backends use to specify
  your project's basic metadata, such as the dependencies, your name, etc.

- The ``[tool]`` table has tool-specific subtables, e.g., ``[tool.hatch]``,
  ``[tool.black]``, ``[tool.mypy]``. We only touch upon this table here because
  its contents are defined by each tool. Consult the particular tool's
  documentation to know what it can contain.

.. note::

   The ``[build-system]`` table should always be present,
   regardless of which build backend you use (``[build-system]`` *defines* the
   build tool you use).

   On the other hand, the ``[project]`` table is understood by *most* build
   backends, but some build backends use a different format.

   A notable exception is Poetry_, which before version 2.0 (released January
   5, 2025) did not use the ``[project]`` table, it used the ``[tool.poetry]``
   table instead. With version 2.0, it supports both.
   Also, the setuptools_ build backend supports both the ``[project]`` table,
   and the older format in ``setup.cfg`` or ``setup.py``.

   For new projects, use the ``[project]`` table, and keep ``setup.py`` only if
   some programmatic configuration is needed (such as building C extensions),
   but the ``setup.cfg`` and ``setup.py`` formats are still valid. See
   :ref:`setup-py-deprecated`.


.. _pyproject-guide-build-system-table:

Declaring the build backend
===========================

The ``[build-system]`` table contains a ``build-backend`` key, which specifies
the build backend to be used. It also contains a ``requires`` key, which is a
list of dependencies needed to build the project -- this is typically just the
build backend package, but it may also contain additional dependencies. You can
also constrain the versions, e.g., ``requires = ["setuptools >= 61.0"]``.

Usually, you'll just copy what your build backend's documentation
suggests (after :ref:`choosing your build backend <choosing-build-backend>`).
Here are the values for some common build backends:

.. include:: ../shared/build-backend-tabs.rst


Static vs. dynamic metadata
===========================

The rest of this guide is devoted to the ``[project]`` table.

Most of the time, you will directly write the value of a ``[project]``
field. For example: ``requires-python = ">= 3.8"``, or ``version =
"1.0"``.

However, in some cases, it is useful to let your build backend compute
the metadata for you. For example: many build backends can read the
version from a ``__version__`` attribute in your code, a Git tag, or
similar. In such cases, you should mark the field as dynamic using, e.g.,

.. code-block:: toml

   [project]
   dynamic = ["version"]


When a field is dynamic, it is the build backend's responsibility to
fill it.  Consult your build backend's documentation to learn how it
does it.


Basic information
=================

.. _`setup() name`:

``name``
--------

Put the name of your project on PyPI. This field is required and is the
only field that cannot be marked as dynamic.

.. code-block:: toml

   [project]
   name = "spam-eggs"

The project name must consist of ASCII letters, digits, underscores "``_``",
hyphens "``-``" and periods "``.``". It must not start or end with an
underscore, hyphen or period.

Comparison of project names is case insensitive and treats arbitrarily long runs
of underscores, hyphens, and/or periods as equal.  For example, if you register
a project named ``cool-stuff``, users will be able to download it or declare a
dependency on it using any of the following spellings: ``Cool-Stuff``,
``cool.stuff``, ``COOL_STUFF``, ``CoOl__-.-__sTuFF``.


``version``
-----------

Put the version of your project.

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    version = "2020.0.0"

Some more complicated version specifiers like ``2020.0.0a1`` (for an alpha
release) are possible; see the :ref:`specification <version-specifiers>`
for full details.

This field is required, although it is often marked as dynamic using

.. code-block:: toml

   [project]
   dynamic = ["version"]

This allows use cases such as filling the version from a ``__version__``
attribute or a Git tag. Consult the :ref:`single-source-version`
discussion for more details.


Dependencies and requirements
=============================

``dependencies``/``optional-dependencies``
------------------------------------------

If your project has dependencies, list them like this:

.. code-block:: toml

   [project]
   dependencies = [
     "httpx",
     "gidgethub[httpx]>4.0.0",
     "django>2.1; os_name != 'nt'",
     "django>2.0; os_name == 'nt'",
   ]

See :ref:`Dependency specifiers <dependency-specifiers>` for the full
syntax you can use to constrain versions.

You may want to make some of your dependencies optional, if they are
only needed for a specific feature of your package. In that case, put
them in ``optional-dependencies``.

.. code-block:: toml

    [project.optional-dependencies]
    gui = ["PyQt5"]
    cli = [
      "rich",
      "click",
    ]

Each of the keys defines a "packaging extra". In the example above, one
could use, e.g., ``pip install your-project-name[gui]`` to install your
project with GUI support, adding the PyQt5 dependency.


.. _requires-python:
.. _python_requires:

``requires-python``
-------------------

This lets you declare the minimum version of Python that you support
[#requires-python-upper-bounds]_.

.. code-block:: toml

   [project]
   requires-python = ">= 3.8"


.. _`console_scripts`:

Creating executable scripts
===========================

To install a command as part of your package, declare it in the
``[project.scripts]`` table.

.. code-block:: toml

   [project.scripts]
   spam-cli = "spam:main_cli"

In this example, after installing your project, a ``spam-cli`` command
will be available. Executing this command will do the equivalent of
``import sys; from spam import main_cli; sys.exit(main_cli())``.

On Windows, scripts packaged this way need a terminal, so if you launch
them from within a graphical application, they will make a terminal pop
up. To prevent this from happening, use the ``[project.gui-scripts]``
table instead of ``[project.scripts]``.

.. code-block:: toml

   [project.gui-scripts]
   spam-gui = "spam:main_gui"

In that case, launching your script from the command line will give back
control immediately, leaving the script to run in the background.

The difference between ``[project.scripts]`` and
``[project.gui-scripts]`` is only relevant on Windows.



About your project
==================

``authors``/``maintainers``
---------------------------

Both of these fields contain lists of people identified by a name and/or
an email address.

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    authors = [
      {name = "Pradyun Gedam", email = "pradyun@example.com"},
      {name = "Tzu-Ping Chung", email = "tzu-ping@example.com"},
      {name = "Another person"},
      {email = "different.person@example.com"},
    ]
    maintainers = [
      {name = "Brett Cannon", email = "brett@example.com"}
    ]


.. _description:

``description``
---------------

This should be a one-line description of your project, to show as the "headline"
of your project page on PyPI (`example <pypi-pip_>`_), and other places such as
lists of search results (`example <pypi-search-pip_>`_).

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    description = "Lovely Spam! Wonderful Spam!"


``readme``
----------

This is a longer description of your project, to display on your project
page on PyPI. Typically, your project will have a ``README.md`` or
``README.rst`` file and you just put its file name here.

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    readme = "README.md"

The README's format is auto-detected from the extension:

- ``README.md`` → `GitHub-flavored Markdown <gfm_>`_,
- ``README.rst`` → `reStructuredText <rest_>`_ (without Sphinx extensions).

You can also specify the format explicitly, like this:

.. code-block:: toml

   [project]
   readme = {file = "README.txt", content-type = "text/markdown"}
   # or
   readme = {file = "README.txt", content-type = "text/x-rst"}


.. _license-and-license-files:

``license`` and ``license-files``
---------------------------------

As per :pep:`639` licenses should be declared with two fields:

- ``license`` is an :term:`SPDX license expression <License Expression>` consisting
  of one or more :term:`license identifiers <License Identifier>`.
- ``license-files`` is a list of license file glob patterns.

A previous PEP had specified ``license`` to be a table with a ``file`` or a
``text`` key, this format is now deprecated. Most :term:`build backends<build
backend>` now support the new format as shown in the following table.

.. list-table:: build backend versions that introduced :pep:`639` support
   :header-rows: 1

   * - hatchling
     - setuptools
     - flit-core [#flit-core-pep639]_
     - pdm-backend
     - poetry-core
     - uv-build
   * - 1.27.0
     - 77.0.3
     - 3.12
     - 2.4.0
     - 2.2.0
     - 0.7.19


.. _license:

``license``
'''''''''''

The new format for ``license`` is a valid :term:`SPDX license expression <License Expression>`
consisting of one or more :term:`license identifiers <License Identifier>`.
The full license list is available at the
`SPDX license list page <spdxlicenselist_>`_. The supported list version is
3.17 or any later compatible one.

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    license = "GPL-3.0-or-later"
    # or
    license = "MIT AND (Apache-2.0 OR BSD-2-Clause)"

.. note:: If you get a build error that ``license`` should be a dict/table,
   your build backend doesn't yet support the new format. See the
   `above section <license-and-license-files_>`_ for more context.
   The now deprecated format is `described in PEP 621 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/#license>`__.

As a general rule, it is a good idea to use a standard, well-known
license, both to avoid confusion and because some organizations avoid software
whose license is unapproved.

If your project is licensed with a license that doesn't have an existing SPDX
identifier, you can create a custom one in format ``LicenseRef-[idstring]``.
The custom identifiers must follow the SPDX specification,
`clause 10.1 <spdxcustomids_>`_ of the version 2.2 or any later compatible one.

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    license = "LicenseRef-My-Custom-License"


.. _license-files:

``license-files``
'''''''''''''''''

This is a list of license files and files containing other legal
information you want to distribute with your package.

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    license-files = ["LICEN[CS]E*", "vendored/licenses/*.txt", "AUTHORS.md"]

The glob patterns must follow the specification:

- Alphanumeric characters, underscores (``_``), hyphens (``-``) and dots (``.``)
  will be matched verbatim.
- Special characters: ``*``, ``?``, ``**`` and character ranges: [] are supported.
- Path delimiters must be the forward slash character (``/``).
- Patterns are relative to the directory containing :file:`pyproject.toml`, and
  thus may not start with a slash character.
- Parent directory indicators (``..``) must not be used.
- Each glob must match at least one file.

Literal paths are valid globs.
Any characters or character sequences not covered by this specification are
invalid.


``keywords``
------------

This will help PyPI's search box to suggest your project when people
search for these keywords.

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    keywords = ["egg", "bacon", "sausage", "tomatoes", "Lobster Thermidor"]


.. _classifiers:

``classifiers``
---------------

A list of PyPI classifiers that apply to your project. Check the
`full list of possibilities <classifier-list_>`_.

.. code-block:: toml

    classifiers = [
      # How mature is this project? Common values are
      #   3 - Alpha
      #   4 - Beta
      #   5 - Production/Stable
      "Development Status :: 4 - Beta",

      # Indicate who your project is intended for
      "Intended Audience :: Developers",
      "Topic :: Software Development :: Build Tools",

      # Specify the Python versions you support here.
      "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
      "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6",
      "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.7",
      "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8",
      "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9",
    ]

Although the list of classifiers is often used to declare what Python versions a
project supports, this information is only used for searching and browsing
projects on PyPI, not for installing projects. To actually restrict what Python
versions a project can be installed on, use the :ref:`requires-python` argument.

To prevent a package from being uploaded to PyPI, use the special ``Private ::
Do Not Upload`` classifier. PyPI will always reject packages with classifiers
beginning with ``Private ::``.

.. _writing-pyproject-toml-urls:

``urls``
--------

A list of URLs associated with your project, displayed on the left
sidebar of your PyPI project page.

.. note::

    See :ref:`well-known-labels` for a listing
    of labels that PyPI and other packaging tools are specifically aware of,
    and `PyPI's project metadata docs <https://docs.pypi.org/project_metadata/#project-urls>`_
    for PyPI-specific URL processing.

.. code-block:: toml

   [project.urls]
   Homepage = "https://example.com"
   Documentation = "https://readthedocs.org"
   Repository = "https://github.com/me/spam.git"
   Issues = "https://github.com/me/spam/issues"
   Changelog = "https://github.com/me/spam/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md"

Note that if the label contains spaces, it needs to be quoted, e.g.,
``Website = "https://example.com"`` but
``"Official Website" = "https://example.com"``.

Users are advised to use :ref:`well-known-labels` for their project URLs
where appropriate, since consumers of metadata (like package indices) can
specialize their presentation.

For example in the following metadata, neither ``MyHomepage`` nor
``"Download Link"`` is a well-known label, so they will be rendered verbatim:

.. code-block:: toml

   [project.urls]
   MyHomepage = "https://example.com"
   "Download Link" = "https://example.com/abc.tar.gz"


Whereas in this metadata ``HomePage`` and ``DOWNLOAD`` both have
well-known equivalents (``homepage`` and ``download``), and can be presented
with those semantics in mind (the project's home page and its external
download location, respectively).

.. code-block:: toml

   [project.urls]
   HomePage = "https://example.com"
   DOWNLOAD = "https://example.com/abc.tar.gz"

Advanced plugins
================

Some packages can be extended through plugins. Examples include Pytest_
and Pygments_. To create such a plugin, you need to declare it in a subtable
of ``[project.entry-points]`` like this:

.. code-block:: toml

   [project.entry-points."spam.magical"]
   tomatoes = "spam:main_tomatoes"

See the :ref:`Plugin guide <plugin-entry-points>` for more information.



A full example
==============

.. code-block:: toml

   [build-system]
   requires = ["hatchling"]
   build-backend = "hatchling.build"

   [project]
   name = "spam-eggs"
   version = "2020.0.0"
   dependencies = [
     "httpx",
     "gidgethub[httpx]>4.0.0",
     "django>2.1; os_name != 'nt'",
     "django>2.0; os_name == 'nt'",
   ]
   requires-python = ">=3.8"
   authors = [
     {name = "Pradyun Gedam", email = "pradyun@example.com"},
     {name = "Tzu-Ping Chung", email = "tzu-ping@example.com"},
     {name = "Another person"},
     {email = "different.person@example.com"},
   ]
   maintainers = [
     {name = "Brett Cannon", email = "brett@example.com"}
   ]
   description = "Lovely Spam! Wonderful Spam!"
   readme = "README.rst"
   license = "MIT"
   license-files = ["LICEN[CS]E.*"]
   keywords = ["egg", "bacon", "sausage", "tomatoes", "Lobster Thermidor"]
   classifiers = [
     "Development Status :: 4 - Beta",
     "Programming Language :: Python"
   ]

   [project.optional-dependencies]
   gui = ["PyQt5"]
   cli = [
     "rich",
     "click",
   ]

   [project.urls]
   Homepage = "https://example.com"
   Documentation = "https://readthedocs.org"
   Repository = "https://github.com/me/spam.git"
   "Bug Tracker" = "https://github.com/me/spam/issues"
   Changelog = "https://github.com/me/spam/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md"

   [project.scripts]
   spam-cli = "spam:main_cli"

   [project.gui-scripts]
   spam-gui = "spam:main_gui"

   [project.entry-points."spam.magical"]
   tomatoes = "spam:main_tomatoes"
