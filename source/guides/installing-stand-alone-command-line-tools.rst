Installing stand alone command line tools
=========================================

Many packages have command line entry points. Examples of this type of application are
`mypy <https://github.com/python/mypy>`_,
`flake8 <https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8>`_,
`pipenv <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv>`_,and
`black <https://github.com/ambv/black>`_.

Usually you want to be able to access these from anywhere,
but installing packages and their dependencies to the same global environment
can cause version conflicts and break dependencies the operating system has
on Python packages.

`pipx <https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx>`_ solves this by creating a virtual
environment for each package, while also ensuring that package's applications
are accessible through a directory that is on your ``$PATH``. This allows each
package to be upgraded or uninstalled without causing conflicts with other
packages, and allows you to safely run the program from anywhere.

.. Note:: pipx only works with Python 3.6+.

``pipx`` is installed with ``pip``:

::

  $ python3 -m pip install --user pipx
  $ python3 -m pipx ensurepath  # ensures the path of the CLI application directory is on your $PATH

.. Note:: You may need to restart your terminal for the path updates to take effect.

Now you can install packages with ``pipx install`` and access the package's entry point(s) from anywhere.

::

  $ pipx install PACKAGE
  $ ENTRYPOINT_OF_PACKAGE [ARGS]

For example

::

  $ pipx install cowsay
    installed package cowsay 2.0, Python 3.6.2+
    These binaries are now globally available
      - cowsay
  done! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨
  $ cowsay moo
    ___
  < moo >
    ===
          \
           \
             ^__^
             (oo)\_______
             (__)\       )\/       ||----w |
                 ||     ||

To see a list of packages installed with pipx and which CLI applications are available, use ``pipx list``.

::

  $ pipx list
  venvs are in /Users/user/.local/pipx/venvs
  symlinks to binaries are in /Users/user/.local/bin
     package black 18.9b0, Python 3.6.2+
      - black
      - blackd
     package cowsay 2.0, Python 3.6.2+
      - cowsay
     package mypy 0.660, Python 3.6.2+
      - dmypy
      - mypy
      - stubgen
     package nox 2018.10.17, Python 3.6.2+
      - nox
      - tox-to-nox

To upgrade or uninstall the package

::

  $ pipx upgrade PACKAGE
  $ pipx uninstall PACKAGE

``pipx`` can be upgraded or uninstalled with pip

::

  $ pip install -U pipx
  $ pip uninstall pipx

``pipx`` also allows you to install and run the latest version of a cli tool
in a temporary, ephemeral environment.

::

  $ pipx run PACKAGE [ARGS]

For example

::

  $ pipx run cowsay moooo

To see the full list of commands ``pipx`` offers, run

::

  $ pipx --help
