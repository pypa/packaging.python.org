One of the features of the CPython reference interpreter is that, in
addition to allowing the execution of Python code, it also exposes a rich
C API for use by other software. One of the most common uses of this C API
is to create importable C extensions that allow things which aren't
always easy to achieve in pure Python code.

An overview of binary extensions
================================

Use cases
---------

The typical use cases for binary extensions break down into just three
conventional categories:

* **accelerator modules**: these modules are completely self-contained, and
  are created solely to run faster than the equivalent pure Python code
  runs in CPython. Ideally, accelerator modules will always have a pure
  Python equivalent to use as a fallback if the accelerated version isn't
  available on a given system. The CPython standard library makes extensive
  use of accelerator modules.
  *Example*: When importing ``datetime``, Python falls back to the
  `datetime.py <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/datetime.py>`_
  module if the C implementation (
  `_datetimemodule.c <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Modules/_datetimemodule.c>`_)
  is not available.
* **wrapper modules**: these modules are created to expose existing C interfaces
  to Python code. They may either expose the underlying C interface directly,
  or else expose a more "Pythonic" API that makes use of Python language
  features to make the API easier to use. The CPython standard library makes
  extensive use of wrapper modules.
  *Example*: `functools.py <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/functools.py>`_
  is a Python module wrapper for
  `_functoolsmodule.c <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Modules/_functoolsmodule.c>`_.
* **low-level system access**: these modules are created to access lower level
  features of the CPython runtime, the operating system, or the underlying
  hardware. Through platform specific code, extension modules may achieve
  things that aren't possible in pure Python code. A number of CPython
  standard library modules are written in C in order to access interpreter
  internals that aren't exposed at the language level.
  *Example*: ``sys``, which comes from
  `sysmodule.c <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Python/sysmodule.c>`_.

  One particularly notable feature of C extensions is that, when they don't
  need to call back into the interpreter runtime, they can release CPython's
  global interpreter lock around long-running operations (regardless of
  whether those operations are CPU or IO bound).

Not all extension modules will fit neatly into the above categories. The
extension modules included with NumPy, for example, span all three use cases
- they move inner loops to C for speed reasons, wrap external libraries
written in C, FORTRAN and other languages, and use low level system
interfaces for both CPython and the underlying operation system to support
concurrent execution of vectorised operations and to tightly control the
exact memory layout of created objects.


Disadvantages
-------------

The main disadvantage of using binary extensions is the fact that it makes
subsequent distribution of the software more difficult. One of the
advantages of using Python is that it is largely cross platform, and the
languages used to write extension modules (typically C or C++, but really
any language that can bind to the CPython C API) typically require that
custom binaries be created for different platforms.

This means that binary extensions:

* require that end users be able to either build them from source, or else
  that someone publish pre-built binaries for common platforms

* may not be compatible with different builds of the CPython reference
  interpreter

* often will not work correctly with alternative interpreters such as PyPy,
  IronPython or Jython

* if handcoded, make maintenance more difficult by requiring that
  maintainers be familiar not only with Python, but also with the language
  used to create the binary extension, as well as with the details of the
  CPython C API.

* if a pure Python fallback implementation is provided, make maintenance
  more difficult by requiring that changes be implemented in two places,
  and introducing additional complexity in the test suite to ensure both
  versions are always executed.

Another disadvantage of relying on binary extensions is that alternative
import mechanisms (such as the ability to import modules directly from
zipfiles) often won't work for extension modules (as the dynamic loading
mechanisms on most platforms can only load libraries from disk).


Alternatives to handcoded accelerator modules
---------------------------------------------

When extension modules are just being used to make code run faster (after
profiling has identified the code where the speed increase is worth
additional maintenance effort), a number of other alternatives should
also be considered:

* look for existing optimised alternatives. The CPython standard library
  includes a number of optimised data structures and algorithms (especially
  in the builtins and the ``collections`` and ``itertools`` modules). The
  Python Package Index also offers additional alternatives. Sometimes, the
  appropriate choice of standard library or third party module can avoid the
  need to create your own accelerator module.

* for long running applications, the JIT compiled `PyPy interpreter
  <https://www.pypy.org/>`__ may offer a suitable alternative to the standard
  CPython runtime. The main barrier to adopting PyPy is typically reliance
  on other binary extension modules - while PyPy does emulate the CPython
  C API, modules that rely on that cause problems for the PyPy JIT, and the
  emulation layer can often expose latent defects in extension modules that
  CPython currently tolerates (frequently around reference counting errors -
  an object having one live reference instead of two often won't break
  anything, but no references instead of one is a major problem).

* `Cython <https://cython.org/>`__ is a mature static compiler that can
  compile most Python code to C extension modules. The initial compilation
  provides some speed increases (by bypassing the CPython interpreter layer),
  and Cython's optional static typing features can offer additional
  opportunities for speed increases. Using Cython still carries the
  `disadvantages`_ associated with using binary extensions,
  but has the benefit of having a reduced barrier to entry for Python
  programmers (relative to other languages like C or C++).

* `Numba <http://numba.pydata.org/>`__ is a newer tool, created by members
  of the scientific Python community, that aims to leverage LLVM to allow
  selective compilation of pieces of a Python application to native
  machine code at runtime. It requires that LLVM be available on the
  system where the code is running, but can provide significant speed
  increases, especially for operations that are amenable to vectorisation.


Alternatives to handcoded wrapper modules
-----------------------------------------

The C ABI (Application Binary Interface) is a common standard for sharing
functionality between multiple applications. One of the strengths of the
CPython C API (Application Programming Interface) is allowing Python users
to tap into that functionality. However, wrapping modules by hand is quite
tedious, so a number of other alternative approaches should be considered.

The approaches described below don't simplify the distribution case at all,
but they *can* significantly reduce the maintenance burden of keeping
wrapper modules up to date.

* In addition to being useful for the creation of accelerator modules,
  `Cython <https://cython.org/>`__ is also widely used for creating wrapper
  modules for C or C++ APIs. It involves wrapping the interfaces by
  hand, which gives a wide range of freedom in designing and optimising
  the wrapper code, but may not be a good choice for wrapping very
  large APIs quickly. See the
  `list of third-party tools <https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/AutoPxd>`_
  for automatic wrapping with Cython. It also supports performance-oriented
  Python implementations that provide a CPython-like C-API, such as PyPy
  and Pyston.
  
* :doc:`pybind11 <pybind11:index>` is a pure C++11 library
  that provides a clean C++ interface to the CPython (and PyPy) C API. It
  does not require a pre-processing step; it is written entirely in
  templated C++. Helpers are included for Setuptools or CMake builds. It
  was based on `Boost.Python <https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_76_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html>`__,
  but doesn't require the Boost libraries or BJam.

* :doc:`cffi <cffi:index>` is a project created by some of the PyPy
  developers to make it straightforward for developers that already know
  both Python and C to expose their C modules to Python applications. It
  also makes it relatively straightforward to wrap a C module based on its
  header files, even if you don't know C yourself.

  One of the key advantages of ``cffi`` is that it is compatible with the
  PyPy JIT, allowing CFFI wrapper modules to participate fully in PyPy's
  tracing JIT optimisations.

* `SWIG <http://www.swig.org/>`__ is a wrapper interface generator that
  allows a variety of programming languages, including Python, to interface
  with C and C++ code.

* The standard library's ``ctypes`` module, while useful for getting access
  to C level interfaces when header information isn't available, suffers
  from the fact that it operates solely at the C ABI level, and thus has
  no automatic consistency checking between the interface actually being
  exported by the library and the one declared in the Python code. By
  contrast, the above alternatives are all able to operate at the C *API*
  level, using C header files to ensure consistency between the interface
  exported by the library being wrapped and the one expected by the Python
  wrapper module. While ``cffi`` *can* operate directly at the C ABI level,
  it suffers from the same interface inconsistency problems as ``ctypes``
  when it is used that way.


Alternatives for low level system access
----------------------------------------

For applications that need low level system access (regardless of the
reason), a binary extension module often *is* the best way to go about it.
This is particularly true for low level access to the CPython runtime
itself, since some operations (like releasing the Global Interpreter Lock)
are simply invalid when the interpreter is running code, even if a module
like ``ctypes`` or ``cffi`` is used to obtain access to the relevant C
API interfaces.

For cases where the extension module is manipulating the underlying
operating system or hardware (rather than the CPython runtime), it may
sometimes be better to just write an ordinary C library (or a library in
another systems programming language like C++ or Rust that can export a C
compatible ABI), and then use one of the wrapping techniques described
above to make the interface available as an importable Python module.


Implementing binary extensions
==============================

The CPython :doc:`Extending and Embedding <python:extending/index>`
guide includes an introduction to writing a
:doc:`custom extension module in C <python:extending/extending>`.

   FIXME

   * mention the stable ABI (3.2+, link to the CPython C API docs)
   * mention the module lifecycle
   * mention the challenges of shared static state and subinterpreters
   * mention the implications of the GIL for extension modules
   * mention the memory allocation APIs in 3.4+

   * mention again that all this is one of the reasons why you probably *don't*
     want to handcode your extension modules :)


Building binary extensions
==========================

Building extensions for multiple platforms
------------------------------------------

If you plan to distribute your extension, you should provide
:term:`wheels <Wheel>` for all the platforms you intend to support. For most
extensions, this is at least one package per Python version times the number of
OS and architectures you support.  These are usually built on continuous
integration (CI) systems. There are tools to help you build highly
redistributable binaries from CI; these include :ref:`cibuildwheel` and
:ref:`multibuild`.


Binary extensions for Windows
-----------------------------

Before it is possible to build a binary extension, it is necessary to ensure
that you have a suitable compiler available. On Windows, Visual C is used to
build the official CPython interpreter, and should be used to build compatible
binary extensions.  To set up a build environment for binary extensions, install
`Visual Studio Community Edition <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/>`__
- any recent version is fine.

One caveat: if you use Visual Studio 2019 or later, your extension will depend
on an "extra" file, ``VCRUNTIME140_1.dll``, in addition to the
``VCRUNTIME140.dll`` that all previous versions back to 2015 depend on. This
will add an extra requirement to using your extension on versions of CPython
that do not include this extra file. To avoid this, you can add the
compile-time argument ``/d2FH4-``. Recent versions of Python may include this
file.

Building for Python prior to 3.5 is discouraged, because older versions of
Visual Studio are no longer available from Microsoft. If you do need to build
for older versions, you can set ``DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1`` and ``MSSdk=1`` to
force a the currently activated version of MSVC to be found, and you should
exercise care when designing your extension not to malloc/free memory across
different libraries, avoid relying on changed data structures, and so on. Tools
for generating extension modules usually avoid these things for you.



Binary extensions for Linux
---------------------------

Linux binaries must use a sufficiently old glibc to be compatible with older
distributions. The `manylinux <https://github.com/pypa/manylinux>`_ Docker
images provide a build environment with a glibc old enough to support most
current Linux distributions on common architectures.

Binary extensions for macOS
---------------------------

Binary compatibility on macOS is determined by the target minimum deployment
system, e.g. *10.9*, which is often specified with the
``MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`` environmental variable when building binaries on
macOS. When building with setuptools / distutils, the deployment target is
specified with the flag ``--plat-name``, e.g. ``macosx-10.9-x86_64``. For
common deployment targets for macOS Python distributions, see the `MacPython
Spinning Wheels wiki
<https://github.com/MacPython/wiki/wiki/Spinning-wheels>`_.

Publishing binary extensions
============================

For interim guidance on this topic, see the discussion in
:issue:`this issue <284>`.

..

   FIXME

   * cover publishing as wheel files on PyPI or a custom index server
   * cover creation of Windows and macOS installers
   * cover weak linking
   * mention the fact that Linux distros have a requirement to build from
     source in their own build systems, so binary-only releases are strongly
     discouraged


Additional resources
====================

Cross-platform development and distribution of extension modules is a complex topic,
so this guide focuses primarily on providing pointers to various tools that automate
dealing with the underlying technical challenges. The additional resources in this
section are instead intended for developers looking to understand more about the
underlying binary interfaces that those systems rely on at runtime.

Cross-platform wheel generation with scikit-build
-------------------------------------------------

The `scikit-build <https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ package
helps abstract cross-platform build operations and provides additional capabilities
when creating binary extension packages. Additional documentation is also available on
the `C runtime, compiler, and build system generator
<https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generators.html>`_ for Python
binary extension modules.
