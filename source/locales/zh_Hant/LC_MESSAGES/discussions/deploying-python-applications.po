"`Pynsist <https://pypi.org/project/pynsist>`__ is a tool that bundles "
"Python programs together with the Python-interpreter into a single "
"installer based on NSIS. In most cases, packaging only requires the user "
"to choose a version of the Python-interpreter and declare the "
"dependencies of the program. The tool downloads the specified Python-"
"interpreter for Windows and packages it with all the dependencies in a "
"single Windows-executable installer."

"The installed program can be started from a shortcut that the installer "
"adds to the start-menu. It uses a Python interpreter installed within its"
" application directory, independent of any other Python installation on "
"the computer."

"A big advantage of Pynsist is that the Windows packages can be built on "
"Linux. There are several examples for different kinds of programs "
"(console, GUI) in the `documentation <https://pynsist.readthedocs.io>`__."
