"The current standard format of source distribution format is identified "
"by the presence of a :file:`pyproject.toml` file in the distribution "
"archive.  The layout of such a distribution was originally specified in "
":pep:`517` and is formally documented here."

"There is also the legacy source distribution format, implicitly defined "
"by the behaviour of ``distutils`` module in the standard library, when "
"executing :command:`setup.py sdist`. This document does not attempt to "
"standardise this format, except to note that if a legacy source "
"distribution contains a ``PKG-INFO`` file using metadata version 2.2 or "
"later, then it MUST follow the rules applicable to source distributions "
"defined in the metadata specification."

"The file name of a sdist is not currently standardised, although the *de "

"A ``.tar.gz`` source distribution (sdist) contains a single top-level "
"directory called ``{name}-{version}`` (e.g. ``foo-1.0``), containing the "
"source files of the package. The name and version MUST match the metadata"
" stored in the file. This directory must also contain a "
":file:`pyproject.toml` in the format defined in :ref:`declaring-build-"
"dependencies`, and a ``PKG-INFO`` file containing metadata in the format "
"described in the :ref:`core-metadata` specification. The metadata MUST "
