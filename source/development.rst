In addition to the work required to create a Python package, it is often
necessary that the package must be made available on different versions of
Python.  Different Python versions may contain different (or renamed) standard
library packages, and the changes between Python versions 2.x and 3.x include
changes in the language syntax.

Performed manually, all the testing required to ensure that the package works
correctly on all the target Python versions (and OSs!) could be very
time-consuming. Fortunately, several tools are available for dealing with
this, and these will briefly be discussed here.

Automated Testing and Continuous Integration
--------------------------------------------

Several hosted services for automated testing are available. These services
will typically monitor your source code repository (e.g. at
`Github <https://github.com>`_ or `Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org>`_)
and run your project's test suite every time a new commit is made.

These services also offer facilities to run your project's test suite on
*multiple versions of Python*, giving rapid feedback about whether the code
will work, without the developer having to perform such tests themselves.

Wikipedia has an extensive `comparison
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_continuous_integration_software>`_
of many continuous-integration systems. There are two hosted services which
when used in conjunction provide automated testing across Linux, Mac and
Windows:

  - `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org>`_ provides both a Linux and a Mac OSX
    environment. The Linux environment is Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server Edition 64 bit
    while the OSX is 10.9.2 at the time of writing.
  - `Appveyor <http://www.appveyor.com>`_ provides a Windows environment
    (Windows Server 2012).

::

    TODO Either link to or provide example .yml files for these two
    services.

    TODO How do we keep the Travis Linux and OSX versions up-to-date in this
    document?

Both `Travis CI`_ and Appveyor_ require a `YAML
<http://www.yaml.org>`_-formatted file as specification for the instructions
for testing. If any tests fail, the output log for that specific configuration
can be inspected.

For Python projects that are intended to be deployed on both Python 2 and 3
with a single-source strategy, there are a number of options.

Tools for single-source Python packages
----------------------------------------

`six <http://pythonhosted.org/six/>`_ is a tool developed by Benjamin Peterson
for wrapping over the differences between Python 2 and Python 3. The six_
package has enjoyed widespread use and may be regarded as a reliable way to
write a single-source python module that can be use in both Python 2 and 3.
The six_ module can be used from as early as Python 2.5. A tool called
`modernize <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/modernize>`_, developed by Armin
Ronacher, can be used to automatically apply the code modifications provided
by six_.

Similar to six_, `python-future <http://python-future.org/overview.html>`_ is
a package that provides a compatibility layer between Python 2 and Python 3
source code; however, unlike six_, this package aims to provide
interoperability between Python 2 and Python 3 with a language syntax that
matches one of the two Python versions: one may
use

  - a Python 2 (by syntax) module in a Python 3 project.
  - a Python 3 (by syntax) module in a *Python 2* project.

Because of the bi-directionality, python-future_ offers a pathway to
converting a Python 2 package to Python 3 syntax module-by-module. However, in
contrast to six_, python-future_ is supported only from Python 2.6. Similar to
modernize_ for six_, python-future_ comes with two scripts called ``futurize``
and ``pasteurize`` that can be applied to either a Python 2 module or a Python
3 module respectively.

Use of six_ or python-future_ adds an additional runtime dependency to your
package: with python-future_, the ``futurize`` script can be called with the
``--stage1`` option to apply only the changes that Python 2.6+ already
provides for forward-compatibility to Python 3. Any remaining compatibility
problems would require manual changes.

What's in Which Python?
-----------------------

Ned Batchelder provides a list of changes in each Python release for
`Python 2 <http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201109/whats_in_which_python.html>`__
and separately
for `Python 3 <http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201310/whats_in_which_python_3.html>`__.
These lists may be used to check whether any changes between Python versions
may affect your package.

::

    TODO These lists should be reproduced here (with permission).

    TODO The py3 list should be updated to include 3.4



.. _`Single sourcing the version`:

Single-sourcing the version across ``setup.py`` and your project
================================================================

There are a few techniques to store the version in your project code without duplicating the value stored in
``setup.py``:

#.  Read the file in ``setup.py`` and parse the version with a regex. Example (
    from `pip setup.py <https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/1.5.6/setup.py#L33>`_)::

        def read(*names, **kwargs):
            return io.open(
                os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), *names),
                encoding=kwargs.get("encoding", "utf8")
            ).read()

        def find_version(*file_paths):
            version_file = read(*file_paths)
            version_match = re.search(r"^__version__ = ['\"]([^'\"]*)['\"]",
                                      version_file, re.M)
            if version_match:
                return version_match.group(1)
            raise RuntimeError("Unable to find version string.")

        setup(
           ...
           version=find_version("package/__init__.py")
           ...
        )

    .. note::

        This technique has the disadvantage of having to deal with complexities of regular expressions.

#.  Use an external build tool that either manages updating both locations, or
    offers an API that both locations can use.

    Few tools you could use, in no particular order, and not necessarily complete:
    `bumpversion <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bumpversion>`_,
    `changes <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/changes>`_, `zest.releaser <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zest.releaser>`_.


#.  Set the value to a ``__version__`` global variable in a dedicated module in
    your project (e.g. ``version.py``), then have ``setup.py`` read and ``exec`` the
    value into a variable.

    Using ``execfile``:

    ::

        execfile('...sample/version.py')
        assert __version__ == '1.2.0'

    Using ``exec``:

    ::

        version = {}
        with open("...sample/version.py") as fp:
            exec(fp.read(), version)
        assert version['__version__'] == '1.2.0'

    Example using this technique: `warehouse <https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/blob/master/warehouse/__about__.py>`_.

#.  Place the value in a simple ``VERSION`` text file and have both ``setup.py``
    and the project code read it.

    ::

        version_file = open(os.path.join(mypackage_root_dir, 'VERSION'))
        version = version_file.read().strip()

    An advantage with this technique is that it's not specific to Python.  Any
    tool can read the version.

    .. warning::

        With this approach you must make sure that the ``VERSION`` file is included in
        all your source and binary :term:`packages <distribution package>`.

#.  Set the value in ``setup.py``, and have the project code use the
    ``pkg_resources`` API.

    ::

        import pkg_resources
        assert pkg_resources.get_distribution('pip').version == '1.2.0'

    Be aware that the ``pkg_resources`` API only knows about what's in the
    installation metadata, which is not necessarily the code that's currently
    imported.


#.  Set the value to ``__version__`` in ``sample/__init__.py`` and import
    ``sample`` in ``setup.py``.

    ::

        import sample
        setup(
            ...
            version=sample.__version__
            ...
        )

    Although this technique is common, beware that it will fail if
    ``sample/__init__.py`` imports packages from ``install_requires``
    dependencies, which will very likely not be installed yet when ``setup.py``
    is run.


.. _`PyPI mirrors and caches`:

PyPI mirrors and caches
=======================

Mirroring or caching of PyPI can be used to speed up local :term:`package <distribution package>`
installation, allow offline work, handle corporate firewalls or just plain
Internet flakiness.

Three options are available in this area:

1. pip provides local caching options,
2. devpi provides higher-level caching option, potentially shared amongst
   many users or machines, and
3. bandersnatch provides a local complete mirror of all PyPI :term:`packages <distribution package>`.


Caching with pip
----------------

pip provides a number of facilities for speeding up installation by using
local cached copies of :term:`packages <distribution package>`:

1. `Fast & local installs
   <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html#fast-local-installs>`_ by
   downloading all the requirements for a project and then pointing pip at
   those downloaded files instead of going to PyPI.
2. A variation on the above which pre-builds the installation files for
   the requirements using `pip wheel
   <http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/pip_wheel.html>`_::

    $ pip wheel --wheel-dir=/tmp/wheelhouse SomeProject
    $ pip install --no-index --find-links=/tmp/wheelhouse SomeProject


Caching with devpi
------------------

devpi is a caching proxy server which you run on your laptop, or some other
machine you know will always be available to you. See the `devpi
documentation for getting started`__.

__ http://doc.devpi.net/latest/quickstart-pypimirror.html


Complete mirror with bandersnatch
----------------------------------

bandersnatch will set up a complete local mirror of all PyPI :term:`packages <distribution package>`
(externally-hosted packages are not mirrored). See the
`bandersnatch documentation for getting that going`__.

__ https://bitbucket.org/pypa/bandersnatch/overview

A benefit of devpi is that it will create a mirror which includes packages
that are external to PyPI, unlike bandersnatch which will only cache packages
hosted on PyPI.


.. _`Patching & Forking`:

Patching & Forking
==================

::

  FIXME

  - locally patch 3rd-part projects to deal with unfixed bugs
     - old style pkg_resources "patch releases":  1.3-fork1
     - PEP440's local identifiers: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#local-version-identifiers
  - fork and publish when you need to publish a project that depends on the fork
     (DONT use dependency links)
