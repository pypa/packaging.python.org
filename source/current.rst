Tool Recommendations

If you're familiar with Python packaging and installation, and just want to know
what tools are currently recommended, then here it is.


Installation Tool Recommendations
=================================

* Use :ref:`pip` to install Python :term:`packages <distribution package>` from
  :term:`PyPI <Python Package Index (PyPI)>`. [1]_ [2]_

* Use :ref:`virtualenv`, or `pyvenv`_ to isolate application specific
  dependencies from a shared Python installation. [3]_

* Use `pip wheel
  <http://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_wheel.html>`_ to create a
  cache of :term:`wheel` packages, for the purpose of speeding up
  subsequent installations. [4]_

* If you're looking for management of fully integrated cross-platform software
  stacks, consider :ref:`buildout` (primarily focused on the web development
  community) or :ref:`hashdist`, or :ref:`conda` (both primarily focused on
  the scientific community).



Packaging Tool Recommendations
==============================

* Use :ref:`setuptools` to define projects and create :term:`Source Distributions
  <Source Distribution (or "sdist")>`. [5]_ [6]_

* Use the ``bdist_wheel`` :ref:`setuptools` extension available from the
  :ref:`wheel project <wheel>` to create :term:`wheels <Wheel>`.  This is
  especially beneficial, if your project contains binary extensions. [7]_

* Use `twine <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine>`_ for uploading
  :term:`packages <distribution package>` to :term:`PyPI <Python Package Index (PyPI)>`.

.. [1] There are some cases where you might choose to use ``easy_install`` (from
       :ref:`setuptools`), e.g. if you need to install from :term:`Eggs <Egg>`
       (which pip doesn't support).  For a detailed breakdown, see :ref:`pip vs
       easy_install`.

.. [2] The acceptance of :ref:`PEP453 <PEP453s>` means that :ref:`pip` will be
       available by default in most installations of Python 3.4 or later.  See
       the `rationale section
       <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0453/#rationale>`_ from :ref:`PEP453
       <PEP453s>` as for why pip was chosen.

.. [3] Beginning with Python 3.4, ``pyvenv`` will create virtualenv environments
       with ``pip`` installed, thereby making it an equal alternative to
       :ref:`virtualenv`. However, using :ref:`virtualenv` will still be
       recommended for users that need cross-version consistency.

.. [4] For more information, see the pip guide to `Installing from Wheels
       <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html#installing-from-wheels>`_.

.. [5] Although you can use pure ``distutils`` for many projects, it does not
       support defining dependencies on other projects and is missing several
       convenience utilities for automatically populating
       :term:`package <distribution package>` metadata
       correctly that are provided by ``setuptools``. Being outside the
       standard library, ``setuptools`` also offers a more consistent feature
       set across different versions of Python, and (unlike ``distutils``),
       ``setuptools`` will be updated to produce the upcoming "Metadata 2.0"
       standard formats on all supported versions.

       Even for projects that do choose to use ``distutils``, when :ref:`pip`
       installs such projects directly from source (rather than installing
       from a prebuilt :term:`wheel <Wheel>` file), it will actually build
       your project using :ref:`setuptools` instead.

.. [6] `distribute`_ (a fork of setuptools) was merged back into
       :ref:`setuptools` in June 2013, thereby making setuptools the default
       choice for packaging.

.. [7] :term:`PyPI <Python Package Index (PyPI)>` currently only allows
       uploading Windows and Mac OS X wheels, and they should be compatible with
       the binary installers provided for download from python.org. Enhancements
       will have to be made to the :ref:`wheel compatibility tagging scheme
       <PEP425s>` before linux wheels will be allowed.
