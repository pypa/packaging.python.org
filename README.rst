Python Packaging User Guide
===========================

The "Python Packaging User Guide" (PyPUG) aims to be the authoritative resource on
how to create and install packages in Python using current tools, but also
on the efforts to improve python packaging. The guide is part of a larger effort
to improve all of the packaging and installation docs, including pip,
setuptools, virtualenv, wheel, distlib, and docs.python.org.

The guide is currently maintained by the "Python Packaging Authority" (PyPA).
It was forked from the “Hitchhikers Guide to Packaging” in March 2013, which was
maintained by Tarek Ziadé.  Thankyou Tarek for all your efforts in python
packaging.

The html version of the Guide is currently available online at
http://packaging.python.org.
